How to use this manual Instructions are provided below on how to use this manual, including aspects of navigation, table filtering, plot animation and network diagram interaction. These instructions are not provided elsewhere. Navigation This manual is designed for digital use within any web browser and has the following features: Section headers, to level three, are directly navigable via the left hand panes table of contents. This table of contents pane can be toggled on and off from view via the s key if more or less page width is required The angled arrows that float at the left and right hand side midpoints of every page can be used to navigate sequentially back and forth to the commencement of preceding or subsequent top level sections Model commands, parameters and cross references for tables and figures are navigable through hyperlinks, where appropriate. This includes parameters within equations, which will also appear as blue hyperlinks when active The space bar can be used to scroll down within each page without skipping text. Shift + space bar will similarly scroll up Browser back and forward buttons (or their equivalent keyboard shortcuts alt + \\(\\langle\\)left arrow\\(\\rangle\\) and alt + \\(\\langle\\)right arrow\\(\\rangle\\), respectively) can be used to navigate through browsing history. Some browsers may not return to the location in a page last visited, but to the last clicked section header. Hyperlinks have been built into the body of the manual to avoid this potential and these hyperlinks should be used to navigate back and forth in the first instance It is recommended that this manual be viewed in a browser window that is maximised or operating in full screen mode, with the latter (although browser dependent) typically toggled via the F11 key. When following hyperlinks, the target is displayed at the top of the landing page. The exception to this occurs when a target is located near the bottom of the landing pages content. In this case the target will appear below the top of the landing page. Searching This entire manual content can be searched by using the search box at the top of the table of contents pane (i.e. screen top left near the TUFLOW logo). This search box can be toggled on and off by clicking the search icon (magnifying glass) at the top left of any page. The table of contents is dynamically filtered in response to entering text in the search box, and clicking on any remaining table of contents entry will navigate directly to the searched text. Searched text will be highlighted within a page for easy identification, and multiple instances within one page can be navigated through by using the up and down arrow keys. Clearing the search box will restore the table of contents. Tables Where appropriate, tables are searchable via use of the search box, which is located at the top right of any search enabled table. Not all tables are searchable. When text is entered into the search box, table rows are dynamically filtered to only show those that contain the search text. This allows on-the-fly condensing of large tables so that only relevant content is presented. Tables can be sorted alphabetically (or reverse alphabetically) with respect to any column by clicking column headers. Where appropriate, the number of rows displayed is selectable via the Show entries drop down. Undisplayed rows can be accessed by clicking Previous or Next or by using the numbered navigation boxes, all of which are located at the bottom of each table. Below is an example of a searchable table. Type nitrate (without the inverted commas) into the search box to see the table behaviour, or change the number of rows displayed (given this demonstration table has nine rows, only selecting 5 will change the number of rows displayed) and use the navigation buttons at the bottom of the table to look through all the data. The right hand column has hyperlinked words that allow navigation between related commands, or different versions of the same command, for ease of access. All hyperlinks have been deliberately disabled in this demonstration table, but are active (and explained) in live tables elsewhere in this manual.

Simulation construction section 4.7.3.4.1 \\(\\text{ }\\) Colour coding is often used for distinguishing different tabulated data types. In the above example, WQM commands are pink and the associated argument options for each command are blue and contained in angled parentheses. Colour coding applied to other table types is explained throughout this manual when required. Figures Where appropriate, this manual contains interactive figures that support understanding of processes and the influence of specifiable parameters on water quality outcomes. The figure below provides an example. Move the slider or press play to see the effect a sediment property has on water column concentrations. Zoom in by clicking and dragging out a box within the plot axes to be enlarged, and double click to return to the original axis limits. Mouse hover over a line on the figure to see plotted values. Networks Interactive networks are used to assist in describing simulation architectures and process descriptions. In all cases, networks comprise nodes and connecting lines. In the case of architecture networks, nodes are coloured and labelled circles. These nodes represent items within water quality architectural levels and are coloured as simulation classes, model classes, constituent models, or computed variables. Architectural relationships are displayed as connecting directional lines, with each lines colour matching that of its originating node In the case of process descriptions, nodes are coloured and labelled and are either circles (processes) or squares (computed variables). Circular process nodes are coloured as sources or sinks of computed variables. Where a process is both source and sink, its fill and outline are coloured accordingly. Square computed variables are all presented as the same colour. Process and computed variable relationships are displayed as connecting directional lines, with each lines colour indicating whether its direction is a source or sink with respect to its originating node. Connecting lines may have midpoint labels, and where present, these indicate indirect relationships to additional processes or computed variables. Single click anywhere on a network to activate interaction. A clicked network will show as being boxed in blue when activated. Once activated: Single click or hover over a node to highlight its nearest neighbours. Single clicking anywhere off the network will deselect these. The intention is that this allows users to quickly identify related processes and computed variables Use the Select by id drop down menu to select a particular node of interest. Its nearest neighbours will also be automatically selected Single click, hold and drag a node to drag the network or node Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the network Double click on any node that has the label starting text Cluster on group :. This will explode the nodes to see its containing subsidiary nodes Double click on any node within an exploded group to implode the group back to its original state Click the Reinitialize clustering button at the bottom of a network that uses clustering to return an exploded network to its original position, zoom and unexploded state. Not all networks use clustering so this button may not always be present Networks are deactivated when anywhere outside its blue box is clicked. In some instances, the network may explode to a position outside the original view frame, and some nodes or connecting lines might disappear. This is intentional, and prevents networks rescaling and becoming unreadably small. If this does happen and content of interest is off screen, simply use the mouse wheel to zoom out, or click, hold and drag the network in a direction that will bring obscured nodes back on screen, or do both. Below are example architecture and process description networks to explore. Commands Where specific commands are described, they appear in highlighted text, and often as a clickable link to the corresponding command description in Appendix B. That Appendix is a searchable table of all commands, as per the demonstration table presented in this section. The below is an example of a WQM command (the hyperlink has been disabled for this example). \\(\\newcommand{\\blockindent}{\\hspace{0.5cm}}\\) simulation class == Where commands specify computed variable parameters (e.g. half saturation concentrations, sediment fluxes etc.) then for consistency and brevity, these parameters are included directly in the command example using their notation (see following section that describes notation) rather than descriptive words. These notated parameters are also often a clickable link to descriptive explanations in Appendix Q. The link below is an example of a WQM command with variables presented in their respective notations. Hyperlinks have been removed in this example. \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen benthic == \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\), \\(\\theta_{sed}^{O_2}\\) Parameter notation The primary groups of computed variable parameters are listed below, with the letter or symbol used to denote each. Typical generalisations of units are parenthesised. Fluxes, \\(F\\) (mass/moles per unit area/volume per unit time) Rates, \\(R\\) (per unit time) Concentrations, \\(K\\) (mass or moles per unit volume) Temperature coefficients, \\(\\theta\\) (dimensionless) Fractions, \\(f\\) (dimensionless decimal between 0.0 and 1.0) Ratios, \\(X\\) (dimensionless decimal that may be greater than 1.0, but always non-negative) Limitation functions, \\(L\\) (a dimensionless decimal between 0.0 and 1.0) Power exponents, \\(P\\) (typically dimensionless), and Velocities, \\(V\\) (metres per day) Typically (but not always) an instance of each of these groups will describe a computed variable and a process. Where appropriate, the computed variable and process are denoted as superscripts and subscripts, respectively. For example: The flux of oxygen across the sediment-water interface is notated as \\(F_{sed}^{O_2}\\) The rate of denitrification of nitrate is notated as \\(R_{denit}^{NO_3}\\), The half saturation concentration of oxygen controlling the flux of free reactive phosphorus across the sediment-water interface is notated as \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{FRP}\\) The temperature coefficient controlling the flux of ammonium across the sediment-water interface is notated as \\(\\theta_{sed}^{NH_4}\\) The fraction of total nitrogen rainfall concentration (or dry atmospheric fallout) that is nitrate is notated as \\(f_{atm-TN}^{NO_3}\\) In describing calculation processes (primarily in the Appendices) where a quantity is recomputed by the WQM as a direct modification of a user input or previously calculated quantity, then \\(\\left&lt; computed \\right&gt;\\) is used in the quantitys subscript. For example, a user can specify a sediment flux of ammonium, which is a parameter notated as \\(F_{sed}^{NH_4}\\). The WQM can modify this parameter based on dynamic environmental conditions, and if so, the modified quantity is notated as \\(F_{sed \\left&lt; computed \\right&gt;}^{NH_4}\\). Concentration nomenclature Examples of processes and model simulations are provided in this manual, and these in turn refer to computed variable concentrations. These concentrations are denoted in square brackets, such as \\(\\left[NO_3\\right]\\) for nitrate. The commonly accepted nomenclature for these variable concentrations is used in this manual, such as nitrate concentration. The numerical value of this concentration refers, however, to the concentration of elemental nitrogen within nitrate molecules: 6 mg/L of nitrate means 6 mg/L of elemental nitrogen that is contained within nitrate molecules, not 6 mg/L of nitrate molecules. This is implicit in all references to all computed variables. More detail in this regard is provided in Section 4.2, which should be reviewed carefully. Feedback Constructive suggestions to improve this manual are welcome, and can be emailed to support@tuflow.com. "],["Overview-1.html", "Section 1 Overview 1.1 Context 1.2 Features 1.3 Science 1.4 Support", " Section 1 Overview 1.1 Context The TUFLOW Water Quality Module (WQM) enables the two- or three-dimensional simulation of water quality and ecological processes in natural and constructed waterways such as (but not limited to) lakes, tidal estuaries, river systems and coastal oceans. The modules design is flexible so as to support tailoring of its setup to meet individual application demands and complexity. TUFLOWs WQM is currently supported for use with TUFLOW FV. \\(\\newcommand{\\blockindent}{\\hspace{0.5cm}}\\) 1.2 Features 1.2.1 Usability Several key features have been included in the design of the WQM to support its use. Some are listed below. Simulation units. The units of simulation (including specification of initial conditions, boundary conditions and computed variable parameters) can be selected as either the commonly used mg/L (and \\(\\mu\\)g/L for phytoplankton) system, or the mmol/m\\(^3\\) system Library defaults. The WQM comes packaged with a fully populated library of default settings for all computed variable parameters. This means that users can quickly set up water quality simulations that automatically draw on these library defaults, with a view to then progressively overriding these defaults and therefore customising simulations to suit Command syntax. The WQM uses familiar TUFLOW style command == argument(s) syntax that has a long established pedigree within other TUFLOW products, for example: \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen benthic == 4.0, 1.07 Log file user feedback. WQM simulations generate a log file that reports all simulation configuration details for review Output variable names. The WQM output variable names are descriptive and include the units used, for example WQ_DISSOLVED_OXYGEN_MGL Specification of concentration limits. The WQM allows users to optionally specify minimum and maximum concentation limits for each computed variable, and the WQM will reset concentrations to these limits if exceedences are detected. All instances of resetting are reported to the WQM log file as continuous commentary Inbuilt guidance on parameter specification. The WQM checks all user specified parameters and compares them to typical ranges. If a parameters specified value falls outside a typical range, then a warning is reported to the WQM log file. These ranges are listed in Appendix Q of this manual 1.2.2 Constituents and processes Constituents currently simulated by the WQM include: Dissolved oxygen Silicate Inorganic nitrogen Inorganic phosphorus Organic matter (labile and refractory), and Phytoplankton (multiple groups) Processes captured by the WQM include: Water column transformations between constituents (e.g. nitrification) Benthic sediment  water column interactions (e.g. sediment oxygen consumption) Atmospheric exchange (e.g. oxygen dissolution and rainfall deposition) Primary productivity, respiration and exudation of one or more phytoplankton groups Future near-term releases of the WQM will include the ability to simulate: Pathogens Zooplankton Biogeochemical particles (linked dynamically to TUFLOW FVs Particle Tracking Module (PTM)) Benthos (e.g. bivalves and macrophytes) Future mid-term releases will include: Sediment diagenesis Geochemistry 1.3 Science The science underpinning the WQM is that developed at the School of Agriculture and Environments Oceans Institute at The University of Western Australia. The WQM has wrapped this world class science into a form that is easily accessed via familiar TUFLOW style commands and workflows, and offers the additional features described in Section 1.2.1. 1.4 Support BMT sells, distributes and supports the WQM. Contact support@tuflow.com or sales@tuflow.com for support and sales inquiries. Several supporting appendices have also been included in this manual. These contain interactive content to assist users in understanding and applying the WQM, beyond what might typically be included in a static user manual. These Appendices are: Appendix A Description of command syntax and nomenclature Appendix B Listing of all commands, and their syntax, arguments, descriptions and cross references Appendices C to N Detailed process descriptions, including worked examples using a purpose built small demonstration model Appendix O Listing and descriptions of all computed variables, with supporting information Appendix P Listing and descriptions of all computed diagnostic variables, with supporting information Appendix Q Explanations of all parameters, with symbology, minimums and maximum values, units and commentary Appendix R Demonstration of the mass balance properties of core WQM computed variables "],["Architecture-1.html", "Section 2 Architecture 2.1 Context 2.2 Simulation Tiers 2.3 Linkage with TUFLOW FV 2.4 Linkage with Other Hydrodynamic Models", " Section 2 Architecture This section provides a description of the WQMs architecture. This description is intentionally introductory, and details required to set up and execute simulations that deploy the WQM are provided in Section 4. The manuals introduction should be reviewed for instructions regarding the use of interactive components deployed in this manual. \\(\\newcommand{\\blockindent}{\\hspace{0.5cm}}\\) 2.1 Context As our understanding of the natural environment advances, the questions asked of water quality and ecological numerical models are rapidly increasing in breadth and complexity. Setting up, calibrating and executing defensible environmental models has therefore become an increasingly challenging proposition. The architecture of the WQM has been deliberately designed to assist users in overcoming some of these challenges, and in doing so improve the efficiency and effectiveness with which numerical modelling can support environmental management. Importantly, the WQMs architecture provides a mechanism by which users can rapidly initiate and execute water quality simulations without (at least in early modelling stages) concerning themselves with the often time consuming set up and parameterisation of simulated environmental processes. In short, the WQM has been designed to provide immediate and easy access to its supporting state of the art environmental modelling science. The architecture that provides this easy access is tiered and these tiers are described below. 2.2 Simulation Tiers The WQMs tiers are described below using the nomenclature of Figure 2.1. Every WQM simulation has the following tiers: Tier 1: Exactly one instance from a simulation class. This is user defined Tier 2: A suite of instances from a model class. The suite (and therefore number) of these instances is preset per simulation class. The exception to this is the phytoplankton model class, which when included in a simulation class can have as many instances within the suite as required by the user, with one instance (the default) per simulated phytoplankton group Tier 3: Exactly one constituent model per model class instance (these are user selectable and there may be more than one constituent model available to choose from within a given model class instance) Tier 4: At least one computed variable per constituent model (the suite of computed variables is preset within each constituent model) Figure 2.1: WQM tiers Notwithstanding the above, a user need not specify any of the above in order to rapidly set up and execute a first pass WQM simulation. In this case, the WQM will automatically set the simplest instances of the simulation class, model classes, constituent models and computed variables by drawing on library defaults. Simulation tiers are described below. 2.2.1 Tier 1: Simulation Class This is the highest and overarching tier of the WQMs architecture. Using a single command, this tier sets the overall water quality simulation structure, including the suite of model classes to be deployed (with potentially multiple phytoplankton model classes), and therefore the corresponding suite of constituent models and computed variables. The available simulation classes are provided in Table 2.1 as their keywords, together with example uses of each. The simulation class instances are cumulative, that is, a more complex class instance will include all the capability of simpler class instances. Complexity increases with table row in Table 2.1. Table 2.1: WQM simulation class instances Simulation Class Instance Potential Uses DO Simulation of rudimentary dissolved oxygen dynamics such as:\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Desalination return water impact analyses\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Seasonal reservoir oxygen analyses\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Agricultural drain oxygen analyses Inorganics Simulation of relatively simple aquatic ecosystems that experience primary productivity such as:\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Shallow urban lakes\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Smaller estuaries\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Coastal ocean zones that are relatively free of organic materials or sediments\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Mine voids Organics Simulation of more complex aquatic ecosystems such as:\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Impacted coastal embayments or nearshore zones\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Impacted lakes\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Larger estuaries\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Wetlands\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Aquaculture operations\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Environments receiving point and/or diffuse source organic pollutants Users can simply specify one preset simulation class (e.g. organics) in a water quality control file (Section 4.4 and following sections), and the WQM will draw on inbuilt library defaults to automatically construct and execute a water quality simulation, with no further user input required (beyond specification of water quality initial conditions, see Section 4.4.2). For example, a user may simply specify simulation class == organics and initial conditions, and the WQM will construct itself, execute and report simulation details via a log file. This initial level of simplicity is intended. 2.2.2 Tier 2: Model Class Each simulation class instance contains a preset suite of model class instances. These suites cannot be changed (although there may be multiple phytoplankton model class instances in simulation classes that include phytoplankton), and are provided in Table 2.2 and as a network in Figure 2.2. For example, simulation class instance inorganics has the fixed suite of oxygen, silicate, inorganic nitrogen, inorganic phosphorus and (potentially multiple) phytoplankton model class instances. Table 2.2: WQM simulation class instances and corresponding preset model class suites Simulation Class Instance Model Class Suite DO \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Oxygen Inorganics \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Oxygen\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Silicate\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Inorganic Nitrogen\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Inorganic Phosphorus\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Phytoplankton (potentailly multiple) Organics \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Oxygen\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Silicate\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Inorganic Nitrogen\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Inorganic Phosphorus\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Organic matter\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Phytoplankton (potentially multiple) Figure 2.2: WQM simulation class and model class instances 2.2.3 Tier 3: Constituent Model Whilst the suite of model class instances is set per simulation class instance, constituent models are interchangeable within a model class. In this way, a simulation class instance (at Tier 1) can be customised at the constituent model tier (at Tier 3), despite having a preset suite of model classes (at Tier 2, with potentially multiple phytoplankton model class instances). Available constituent models are provided in Table 2.3, and presented graphically in Figure 2.3 as a direct extension of Figure 2.2. Table 2.3: WQM model classes and corresponding available constituent models Model Class Available Constituent Models Oxygen O2 Silicate Si Inorganic Nitrogen AmmoniumNitrate Inorganic Phosphorus FRPhs FRPhsads Organic Matter Labile Refractory Phytoplankton Basic Advanced Figure 2.3: WQM simulation class and model class instances, with available constituent models For example, multiple inorganic phosphorus constituent models are available within the inorganic phosphorus model class, where these models execute different water quality processes and contain different computed variables. In this example, this can be set with a single line command: inorganic phosphorus model == frphsads \\(\\blockindent\\) \\(\\langle commands \\rangle\\) end inorganic phosphorus model This allows a user to interchange one phosphorus constituent model for another within the inorganic phosphorus model class, thereby customising the overarching simulation class instance. The environmental processes simulated within each constituent model are fixed. Despite this, these processes can nonetheless be switched on and off as required, offering an additional layer of customisation. For example, if oxygen is not required to be included in silicate sediment flux calculations, the linkage between these processes and oxygen can be turned off by setting: oxygen == off Alternatively, if a user wishes to simulate all inorganic processes other than nitrification for example, then the rate describing this unwanted process can simply be set to zero (as per the following command - the first numerical argument is the nitrification rate) and it will be turned off. All library defaults also set rate processes to zero. \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrification == 0.0, 0.0, 1.0 All processes included within each constituent model, and their respective WQM commands, are described in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. 2.2.4 Tier 4: Computed Variables Each Tier 3 constituent model contains a fixed set of computed variables. Table 2.4 (which is a direct extension of Table 2.3) provides the mapping between model classes, constituent models and their associated computed variables. These maps are also provided graphically in Figure 2.4, which is an extension of Figure 2.3, but presented in a non-hierarchical form. Click or hover over nodes to track their paths up or down the simulation tree. For clarity, Figure 2.4 (and elsewhere within this manual) uses acronyms for some computed variable names, and these acronyms are expanded in Appendix O. All references in this manual to organic matter are to labile organic computed variables, unless specifically termed as refractory.

Parameters that are not set by the user are populated automatically from the WQM library defaults. 2.3 Linkage with TUFLOW FV 2.3.1 Process Support is currently provided for linkage of the WQM with TUFLOW FV. Within this linkage, TUFLOW FV considers the WQM as a peripheral model with which it interacts at arms length. The role of TUFLOW FV is that it (in approximate run time order): Requests the number of water quality constituents from the WQM at start up, based on user setup specifications (e.g. the setting of the simulation class instance, with any constituent model modifications) Automatically sets up the corresponding number of tracers (one for each computed variable) within its simulation (users do not specify these tracers) Is then responsible for the: Application of WQM initial conditions Conservative advection and dispersion of these tracers (that represent the WQMs computed variables) Application of WQM boundary conditions Calling the WQM at a user specified time step for the WQM to execute non-conservative transformation calculations on the suite of passive tracers Writing of WQM results files For example, if a WQM simulation was set to consider only dissolved oxygen, then TUFLOW FV would automatically allocate one tracer for the dissolved oxygen variable (the user does not need to specify passive tracers within TUFLOW FV), and advect and disperse that tracer throughout the model domain in response to initial and boundary conditions. At a user defined interval, TUFLOW FV would send the two- or three-dimensional tracer concentration field to the WQM for it to be modified in response to non-conservative ecological processes The WQM would then return this modified tracer field to TUFLOW FV for subsequent advection and dispersion, with this exchange process continuing to simulation end. 2.3.2 Treatment of light The TUFLOW FV heat module must be activated in order to use the WQM. One reason for this (beyond the need to compute water temperature) is that the heat module includes calculation of the light field within the model domain. This light field is used by various WQM constituent models, with the most notable being phytoplankton which uses photosynthetically available radiation (PAR). In order to provide this light field, TUFLOW FV splits the shortwave radiation specified in the heat module into four bands: near infrared (NIR) photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) ultraviolet A (UVA), and ultraviolet B (UVB) This split can be executed using TUFLOW FV defaults, or be user specified. The corresponding band extinction coefficients in water with zero suspended sediment can also be specified in TUFLOW FV. Defaults are also available for all these coefficients. TUFLOW FV uses these coefficients, along with other simulation properties, to compute the four light band intensities at the faces and centroids of each computational cell. These intensities are passed to the WQM for use in constituent model calculations. This approach ensures consistency in the treatment of light between TUFLOW FV and the WQM. The WQM can also modify the light field sent to it from TUFLOW FV via calculation of phytoplankton self shading (section M.1) and the absorption of light due to the presence of organic matter. If this occurs, the WQM returns a modified light extinction coefficient field to TUFLOW FV that is then used in subsequent hydrodynamic heat and light calculations. This modification of light by water quality computed variables only occurs for simulation classes beyond DO. 2.4 Linkage with Other Hydrodynamic Models The above communication between TUFLOW FV and the WQM is affected via implementation of a publicly available application programming interface (API). This API effectively sets the rules by which TUFLOW FV and the WQM communicate, and separates their roles. This API has been designed so that TUFLOW FV can drive any other water quality model that includes the API in its compilation. This is intentional, and allows users of other ecological models to access the hydrodynamic power of TUFLOW FV for their simulations.

"],["ProcessDescriptions-1.html", "Section 3 Process Descriptions 3.1 Simulation Class: DO 3.2 Simulation Class: Inorganics 3.3 Simulation Class: Organics", " Section 3 Process Descriptions Previous chapters have presented an overview of the architecture and capabilities of the WQM, together with a summary of its interactions with TUFLOW FV. This chapter presents the details of each simulation class (see Table 2.1) in terms of its available model classes, the constituent models within those model classes, and the associated computed variables. Process descriptions are listed in this section primarily by name in tables and networks, without inclusion of detail. This is for clarity, with the detailed process descriptions and equations being provided in the Appendices. To facilitate this linkage with supporting material, each process tabulated in this section has been hyperlinked directly to the relevant Appendix, and these hyperlinks colour coded as sources or sinks relative to each computed variable presented. Again for clarity, potential interactions of a computed variable with higher order computed variables (for example oxygen with phytoplankton) are included in this section only in descriptions of those higher order variables and processes. Further: Where a computed variables process is modified by a lower order computed variable (e.g. silicate sediment flux modified by oxygen), then the lower order computed variable name is shown diagrammatically in a contrasting style overlying relevant process arrows in network diagrams Where a computed variable or process directly modifies a lower order computed variable (e.g. phytoplankton respiration consumes dissolved oxygen) then the lower order computed variable is explicitly included in tables and networks Computed variables listed in the tables are hyperlinked to supporting information in Appendix O The manuals introduction should be reviewed for guidance on the use of interactive components deployed in this section. 3.1 Simulation Class: DO 3.1.1 Overview The intent of this simulation class is that it provide a relatively simple entry point to commence water quality modelling. There are many applications for this class. For example it might be used to examine basic oxygen dynamics across seasons in a water supply reservoir or a relatively newly constructed urban lake, or the potential impacts of dense desalination plant return waters on local coastal sediment oxygenation processes. This simulation class includes only the oxygen model class, but given oxygens central role in environmental processes, it provides both a solid foundation for fundamental environmental investigations, and a platform from which to expand to more advanced simulation classes. 3.1.2 Model Class: Oxygen The following constituent models are available to select from within the oxygen model class. 3.1.2.1 Constituent Model: O2 The constituent model code and associated computed variables, processes and potentially interacting simulated quantities are provided in Figure 3.1 and Table 3.1. \\(\\newcommand{\\blockindent}{\\hspace{0.5cm}}\\) Figure 3.1: Constituent model: DO Table 3.1: Constituent model properties: O2 Computed Variables Units Processes Interacting Quantities Dissolved oxygen mg/L or mmol/m\\(^3\\) Atmospheric aeration \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Wind speed\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Dissolved oxygen Sediment flux \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Water temperature\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Dissolved oxygen\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Sediment properties In this relatively simple model, the only process requiring parameterisation is the sediment flux of oxygen. 3.1.3 Computed variables The only computed variable is this simulation class is dissolved oxygen, and as such the overarching simulation class network diagram is the same as that presented in Figure 3.1. 3.2 Simulation Class: Inorganics 3.2.1 Overview The intent of this simulation class is that it provide a framework for simulating typical water quality conditions where organic matter does not play a significant role in ecosystem processes. For example it might be used to examine basic inorganic nutrient processing in nearshore coastal environments that include relatively unimpacted sandy bed conditions, or mine voids that receive little catchment inflow. This simulation class could equally be applied to smaller, well flushed estuaries that receive relatively little catchment derived organic matter, or to basic studies of lakes and water supply reservoirs. The latter cases (amongst others) might also use this simulation class as a stepping stone towards subsequent and more detailed simulations that include organic matter cycling. This would simply require upgrade from this simulation class to the organics simulation class. This simulation class includes the oxygen, silicate, inorganic nitrogen, inorganic phosphorus and phytoplankton model classes. 3.2.2 Model Class: Oxygen This model class is the same as that described in Section 3.1.2. 3.2.3 Model Class: Silicate The following constituent models are available to select from within the silicate model class. 3.2.3.1 Constituent Model: Si The constituent model code and associated variables, processes and potentially interacting simulated quantities are provided in Figure 3.2 and Table 3.2.

By default, this process depends on overlying dissolved oxygen concentrations, but this can optionally be turned off if required. 3.2.4 Model Class: Inorganic nitrogen The following constituent models are available to select from within the inorganic nitrogen model class. 3.2.4.1 Constituent Model: AmmoniumNitrate The constituent model code and associated variables, processes and potentially interacting simulated quantities are provided in Figure 3.3 and Table 3.3.

In addition to specification of two computed variables and their respective sediment flux properties, rates and related parameters for nitrification and denitrification are also specifiable. By design, the library defaults for these processes are set to zero so that all processes are initially inactive. Users may activate these processes by specifying non-zero rate parameters. Whilst dissolved oxygen potentially modifies some processes described to this point (e.g. computed sediment flux rates), nitrification is the first of these processes that also potentially consumes dissolved oxygen. Specifically, if nitrification is simulated (i.e. non-zero rate parameters are specified) and allowed to include the effect of dissolved oxygen (the default), then dissolved oxygen concentrations are drawn down as the process operates.

As such, a WQM simulation will not start if the TUFLOW STM is not activated. In order to use this FRPhsAds constituent model therefore, the following must be in place: The TUFLOW FV STM must be activated and implemented At least one sediment fraction must be set up and executed within TUFLOW FV via the inclusion of a sediment control file, and specification of either of the following TUFLOW FV commands: include sediment == 1,0 ! Do not include sediment in density calculations or include sediment == 1,1 ! Include sediment in density calculations This (or these) sediment fractions must be designated as supporting FRP adsorption and desorption. This is achieved through specification of an upper threshold D\\(_50\\) for adsorption. If multiple sediment fractions are specified to be simulated by the STM, then TUFLOW FV sends all these fractions individually through the API to the WQM, together with their respective metadata fields. Specifically, for each sediment fraction simulated in the TUFLOW FV STM, the WQM is sent: Concentration Settling velocity Resuspension properties, and D\\(_{50}\\) particle diameter The WQM uses this information to compute FRP adsorption and loss of adsorbed FRP through settling, using only those sediment fractions that meet a user specified maximum D\\(_{50}\\) criterion. 3.2.6 Model Class: Phytoplankton The following constituent models are available to select from within the phytoplankton model class. The differentiator between constituent models is the treatment of internal (to a phytoplankton cell) nutrient simulation. 3.2.6.1 Constituent Model: Basic This basic phytoplankton constituent model assumes that the ratios of both internal nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations to internal chlorophyll a (or carbon) concentration are fixed. These internal nutrients are not simulated explicitly, but increase and decrease proportionately with increasing and decreasing carbonaceous biomass, according to the specified (or default) nitrogen-chlorophyll a and phosphorus-chlorophyll a (or their carbon equivalents) ratios. Carbonaceous biomass is simulated dynamically and is the measure of phytoplankton concentration. Internal nutrient concentrations are not required to be specified as initial or boundary conditions, and are not treated as computed variables. The constituent model code and associated computed variables, processes and potentially interacting simulated quantities are provided in Figure 3.6 and Table 3.7. Silicate interactions only apply if phytoplankton is set to uptake silicate via specification of silicate limitation function parameters (section 4.7.3.5.1). The configuration for phytoplankton simulation presented below applies only to the inorganics simulation class. A different, and expanded, configuration applies when phytoplankton is simulated using this basic constituent model in the organics simulation class. This expanded configuration is described in section 3.3.7.1. Figure 3.6: Constituent model: Basic Table 3.7: Constituent model properties: Basic Computed Variables Units Processes Interacting Quantities Phytoplankton \\(\\mu\\)g Chl a/L or mmol C/m\\(^3\\) Primary productivity \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Water temperature\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Salinity\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Light\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Dissolved oxygen\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Ammonium\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Nitrate\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)FRP\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Silicate (if activated) Respiration \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Water temperature\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Salinity\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Light\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Dissolved oxygen Excretion \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Ammonium\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)FRP\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Silicate Mortality \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Ammonium\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)FRP\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Silicate Settling \\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Settling model\\(\\cdot\\blockindent\\)Cell density The three processes that govern phytoplankton behaviour are: Primary productivity (the photosynthetic conversion of light and carbon to stored energy and oxygen, also referred to as growth) Respiration (the expenditure of stored energy and oxygen), and Settling A range of light, temperature, salinity, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate limitation functions can be parameterised and applied in various combinations to the first two processes above, and a range of settling models are available to tailor the third. By design, the associated library default rates are set to zero so as to render all processes initially inactive. Specification of non-zero rates activates these processes. The distinguishing property of this phytoplankton constituent model is that internal (phytoplankton cell) nutrient concentrations are considered to be fixed proportions of cell chlorophyll a (or carbon) concentrations. They are therefore not treated as computed variables, but rather as multiples of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (or carbon) (which is treated as a computed variable). The key implication of this is the method of calculation of the nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and limitation functions applied to primary productivity. These calculations depend only on ambient (i.e. external to a phytoplankton cell) water column nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Simulation of phytoplankton dynamics in the inorganics simulation class directly modifies the concentrations of a range of other computed variables. These are listed in Table 3.8. Silicate interactions only apply if phytoplankton is set to uptake silicate.

These are allowed to vary between upper and lower limits, expressed as ratios to chlorophyll a (or carbon) concentrations. Internal nutrient concentrations (not as ratios) are required to be specified as initial and boundary conditions, and are treated as computed variables. The constituent model code and associated variables, processes and potentially interacting simulated quantities are provided in Figure 3.7 and Table 3.9. Silicate interactions only apply if phytoplankton is set to uptake silicate. The configuration for phytoplankton simulation presented below applies only to the inorganics simulation class. A different, and expanded, configuration applies when phytoplankton is simulated using this advanced constituent model in the organics simulation class. This expanded configuration is described in section 3.3.7.2.

The key implication of this is the method of calculation of the nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and limitation functions applied to primary productivity.

Depending on the constituent model classes deployed, not all of the computed variables and processes shown in the figure will necessarily be active. All network link labels have been removed (other than denoting the relevant phytoplankton model) for clarity. Figure 3.8: Simulation class: Inorganics 3.3 Simulation Class: Organics 3.3.1 Overview The intent of this simulation class is that it provide a relatively advanced water quality modelling tool. There are many applications for this class. For example it might be used to examine detailed reservoir phytoplankton dynamics or the response of an estuary to both inorganic and organic pollutant loading. This simulation class includes the oxygen, silicate, inorganic nitrogen, inorganic phosphorus, organic matter and phytoplankton model classes. 3.3.2 Model Class: Oxygen This constituent model class is the same as that described in Section 3.1.2 3.3.3 Model Class: Silicate This constituent model class is the same as that described in Section 3.2.3 3.3.4 Model Class: Inorganic nitrogen This constituent model class is the same as that described in Section 3.2.4 3.3.5 Model Class: Inorganic phosphorus This constituent model class is the same as that described in Section 3.2.5 3.3.6 Model Class: Organic matter The following constituent models are available to select from within the organic matter model class. The differentiator between constituent models is the inclusion of refractory organic matter. 3.3.6.1 Constituent Model: Labile This organic matter constituent model considers only labile particulate and dissolved organic matter. The constituent model code and associated computed variables, processes and potentially interacting simulated quantities are provided in Figure 3.9 and Table 3.11. Both the Figure and Table (and Table 3.12) make reference to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This is for completeness only because the WQM does not currently support simulation of DIC. Doing so is not required in order to deploy either the labile or refractory organic matter constituent model within the WQM.

By design, the library default rates are set to zero so as to render all processes initially inactive. Specification of non-zero rates activates these processes.

The constituent model code and associated computed variables, processes and potentially interacting simulated quantities are provided in Figure 3.10 and Table 3.13. Both the Figure and Table (and Table 3.14) make reference to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This is for completeness only because the WQM does not currently support simulation of DIC. Doing so is not required in order to deploy either the labile or refractory organic matter constituent model within the WQM.

By design, the library default rates are set to zero so as to render all processes initially inactive. Specification of non-zero rates activates these processes. Simulation of labile and refractory organic dynamics in the organics simulation class directly modifies the concentrations of other computed variables. These are listed in Table 3.14.

These processes and interactions are described below. 3.3.7.1 Constituent Model: Basic As per Section 3.2.6.1, this phytoplankton constituent model assumes that the ratios of both internal nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations to internal chlorophyll a (or carbon) concentration are fixed. These internal nutrients are not simulated explicitly, but increase and decrease proportionately with increasing and decreasing carbonaceous biomass, according to the specified (or default) nitrogen-chlorophyll a and phosphorus-chlorophyll a (or their carbon equivalents) ratios. Carbonaceous biomass is simulated dynamically and is the measure of phytoplankton concentration. Internal nutrient concentrations are not required to be specified as initial or boundary conditions, and are not treated as computed variables. The constituent model code and associated computed variables, processes and potentially interacting simulated quantities are provided in Figure 3.11 and Table 3.15. Silicate interactions only apply if phytoplankton is set to uptake silicate via specification of silicate limitation function parameters (section 4.7.3.5.1). The configuration for phytoplankton simulation presented below applies only to the organics simulation class. A different, and simpler, configuration applies when phytoplankton is simulated using this basic constituent model in the inorganics simulation class. That simplified configuration is described in section 3.2.6.1.

By design, the associated library default rates are set to zero so as to render all processes initially inactive. Specification of non-zero rates activates these processes. The distinguishing property of this phytoplankton constituent model is that internal (phytoplankton cell) nutrient concentrations are considered to be fixed proportions of cell chlorophyll a (or carbon) concentrations. They are therefore not treated as computed variables, but rather as multiples of phytoplankton chlorophyll a (or carbon) (which is treated as a computed variable). The key implication of this is the method of calculation of the nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and limitation functions applied to primary productivity. These calculations depend only on ambient (i.e. external to a phytoplankton cell) water column nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Simulation of phytoplankton dynamics in the organics simulation class directly modifies the concentrations of a range of other computed variables. These are listed in Table 3.16. Silicate interactions only apply if phytoplankton is set to uptake silicate.

These are allowed to vary between upper and lower limits, expressed as ratios to chlorophyll a (or carbon) concentrations. Internal nutrient concentrations (not as ratios) are required to be specified as initial and boundary conditions, and are treated as computed variables. The constituent model code and associated variables, processes and potentially interacting simulated quantities are provided in Figure 3.12 and Table 3.17. Silicate interactions only apply if phytoplankton is set to uptake silicate. The configuration for phytoplankton simulation presented below applies only to the organics simulation class. A different, and simplified, configuration applies when phytoplankton is simulated using this advanced constituent model in the inorganics simulation class. That configuration is described in section 3.2.6.2.

Depending on the constituent model classes deployed, not all of the computed variables and processes shown in the figure will necessarily be active. All network link labels have been removed (other than denoting the relevant phytoplankton model) for clarity.

This section describes the construction of a TUFLOW simulation with the WQM activated. This includes descriptions of all commands, with hyperlinks to the Appendices where commands and explanations are listed in a searchable and sortable table for ease of access. TUFLOW FV is the hydrodynamic model used in all descriptions that follow. 4.2 Units The WQM allows for simulation construction in one of two unit systems (see Section 4.5.1): A milligrams per litre system (which includes micrograms per litre for phytoplankton) that aligns with typical units of laboratory reporting, and A millimoles per cubic metre system A single units system must be adopted for a WQM simulation, and unit systems cannot be mixed within a simulation. This specification has implications for at least the setting of numerical values for: Initial conditions Boundary conditions Computed variable parameters When the milligrams per litre system is used, the WQM executes internal conversions between milligrams and millimoles, because millimoles are the units expected by the core water quality calculation routines. This conversion follows the form: \\[\\begin{equation} n = \\frac{m}{M} \\tag{4.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(n\\) is millimoles (mmol), \\(m\\) is mass (mg) and \\(M\\) is molar weight (mg/mmol). A similar concept applies to concentration and flux quantities. As such, the WQM assigns values to \\(M\\) in converting from milligrams to millimoles, i.e. from user specified milligram initial conditions, boundary conditions and computed variable parameters, to the equivalent millimole quantities. The complete list of values of \\(M\\) for all simulated constituents is provided in Table O.1. The two possibilities for units for each parameter are provided in Appendix Q, where relevant. As an example, if a user specifies the milligrams per litre units system (or allows the same default to be set) and a FRP flux == 3.1 in a materials block, then this value of 3.1 is assumed to be mg/m\\(^2\\)/day. Consistent with typical laboratory reporting conventions (see below), this mass flux is taken to be that of elemental phosphorus \\(P\\), not that of the phosphate molecule \\(PO_4^{3-}\\). This would mean (using Table O.1 and Equation (4.1)) that the equivalent millimole rate would be computed as: \\[\\begin{equation} n = \\frac{3.1}{31} = 0.1 \\hspace{0.1cm} \\text{mmol/m$^2$/day of P} \\tag{4.2} \\end{equation}\\] Given the above, users opting to construct WQM simulations in the milligrams units system need to clearly understand what is being reported in: Field and/or laboratory measurements, and Other numerical model predictions that may be used as WQM boundary conditions (such as catchment pollutant export models) In the case of laboratory nutrient measurements, it is conventional to report concentrations of the typical quantities used by the WQM as silicate-Si, ammonium-N, nitrate-N, FRP-P, organic-C, organic-N, and organic-P. Whilst these quantities might be referred to informally as (for example) nitrate concentrations, the reported number is most commonly the concentration of elemental nitrogen contained within nitrate. To be clear, if a nitrate-N concentration is reported by a laboratory to be 3.5 mg/L, this means that in every litre of water, there are 3.5 milligrams of elemental nitrogen contained within nitrate molecules. Given the molar masses of elemental nitrogen and nitrate, this 3.5 milligrams of elemental N means that there are 15.5 milligrams of nitrate molecules (15.5 = 3.5 x 62/14) in the same litre of water. In this example, the concentration with which the WQM expects to be provided is 3.5 mg/L, not 15.5 mg/L. The use of other model data to force WQM boundary conditions is also interpreted in this way. For example, a catchment model might report that an inflow to the WQM at an upstream riverine boundary condition has a total nitrogen concentration of 10.0 mg/L, and a user may have then speciated this to nitrate by applying a multiplicative factor of 0.15. If this resulting nitrate concentration of 1.5 mg/L is applied to the WQM as a boundary condition, it must be a concentration of elemental nitrogen within nitrate, which is consistent with what would be reported by a laboratory. This means that the user must be sure that the total nitrogen reported by the catchment model is in fact an elemental nitrogen concentration. If users elect to construct WQM simulations in units of millimoles, then no internal WQM conversions take place, and the nature of the quantity (molecular or elemental) being specified is not relevant. For example, the user could specify millimoles units and a FRP flux of 0.1. This could be interpreted as a mmol/m\\(^2\\)/day rate of either the \\(PO_4^{3-}\\) molecule, or just phosphorus \\(P\\). This is because in one millimole of \\(PO_4^{3-}\\), there is also one millimole of elemental \\(P\\). The same one to one relationship holds for all other WQM relevant computed quantities (see Table O.1), other than oxygen which is treated as a diatomic molecule. 4.3 General arrangement A water quality simulation is set up and executed under the umbrella of a TUFLOW FV control file (Figure 4.1, with other optional modules shown for illustrative purposes). That is: The TUFLOW FV control file (*.fvc) file remains the central file that initiates and coordinates an overall simulation. This mirrors the way in which other TUFLOW FV modules, such as the STM and PTM, are activated and executed The TUFLOW FV control file contains a path to a separate WQM control file (*.fvwq) that in turn contains all the commands required to configure a WQM simulation \\(\\newcommand{\\blockindent}{\\hspace{0.5cm}}\\) Figure 4.1: Simulation Coordination TUFLOW FV and WQM control file commands are presented following. 4.4 TUFLOW FV control file commands A TUFLOW FV simulation is executed as described in the TUFLOW FV user manual. If the WQM is to be activated in a simulation then the following commands are to be included. 4.4.1 WQM activation Activation of the WQM is affected by specification of the following mandatory command in the TUFLOW control file: water quality model == TUFLOW Following this activation, TUFLOW FV will look for the specification of the name of the separate WQM control file via the following mandatory command: water quality control file == &lt;water quality control file name&gt;.fvwq This *.fvwq is separate to the *.fvc and contains user specified information that describes the configuration of the water quality simulation. If the *.fvwq is located in the same directory as the *.fvc, then this filename specification needs no associated path. It is recommended however that the *.fvwq be located in a directory separate to the *.fvc so that log and other related water quality specific files can be easily curated. If this approach is adopted, the following additional *.fvc command is required, noting that the folder path is specified as relative to the folder in which the *.fvc resides: water quality model directory == &lt;relative path to WQ directory&gt;\\(\\backslash\\) This command must terminate in a \\(\\backslash\\) character. An example block of these three commands that together activate the WQM and point TUFLOW to the water quality control file ..\\(\\backslash\\)WQ\\(\\backslash\\)Model_000.fvwq is: water quality model == TUFLOW water quality model directory == ..\\WQ\\ water quality control file == .\\Model_000.fvwq 4.4.2 Initial and boundary conditions In addition to activating the WQM and specifying its control file, WQM initial and boundary condition information is also set through the TUFLOW FV control file. The processes for doing so are described below. These are followed by discussion of the related matter of constituent ordering within initial and boundary condition specifications. 4.4.2.1 Initial conditions Water quality initial conditions are specified within the TUFLOW FV control file, akin to the manner in which the sediment initial conditions are set on behalf of the sediment transport module. This specification is mandatory. There are currently a number of ways that water quality initial conditions may be specified, and all are affected through TUFLOW FV commands. If no water quality initial conditions are specified, then a simulation will not execute. Restart files generated from previous simulations can be used to initialise water quality simulations, provided that the restart and simulation model geometries, and water quality simulation computed variables and units are identical. A restart file is specified for all simulated quantities (not just water quality) and is controlled through commands described in the TUFLOW FV user manual. The key command is restart == &lt;restart \\(\\hspace{0.0cm}\\)file name&gt;.rst Other than a restart file, there are a number of ways that water quality initial conditions can be specified, all of which utilise existing TUFLOW FV methods. These are described in the TUFLOW FV user manual, of which some of the following are included: Globally uniform initial wq concentration == ordered initial conditions Globally laterally uniform, but varying with depth initial scalar profile == &lt;initial \\(\\hspace{0.0cm}\\)condition file name&gt;.csv Globally vertically uniform, but varying laterally initial condition 2d == &lt;initial \\(\\hspace{0.0cm}\\)condition file name&gt;.csv Three dimensional spatially varying initial condition 3d == &lt;initial \\(\\hspace{0.0cm}\\)condition file name&gt;.csv Initial conditions that use columnar data structures (e.g. *.csv files, and all of the above commands) are interpreted using the ordering rules noted below. The required ordering for each WQM simulation class is provided subsequently (sections 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 for simulation classes DO, inorganics and organics, respectively). 4.4.2.2 Boundary conditions Water quality boundary conditions are also specified via the *.fvc file, either directly or via an include statement that points TUFLOW FV to a subsidiary boundary condition control file(s). This specification of water quality variable concentrations is optional, so in early water quality model construction stages this specification can be omitted. Omitted water quality boundary conditions will be set to zero. It is not recommended that this approach be taken beyond initial simulation setup stages, but that it be used only to develop a water quality simulation to the point where it executes without issuing error or unwanted warning messages. At this point, all water quality boundary conditions should be assigned. All TUFLOW boundary conditions that specify water temperature or salinity will also require specification of the behaviour of simulated water quality variables. Common boundary conditions to which this applies include inflows (e.g. types Q, QC, QN, QG and others) and tidal boundaries (e.g. types WLS). Wave and meteorological boundary conditions do not need specification of water quality conditions. As for initial conditions, boundary conditions that use columnar data structures (e.g. *.csv files) are interpreted using column headers specified in an expected order within calling TUFLOW FV BC blocks. Further detail and the associated ordering is provided in the following sections (sections 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 for simulation classes DO, inorganics and organics, respectively). 4.4.2.3 Ordering Specification of initial conditions and most boundary conditions presently relies on listing water quality variables in a particular order. This applies in all instances when water quality initial or boundary conditions are provided in columnar or list form, which is most frequently in text file format. This is conceptually similar to the manner in which TUFLOW FV also relies on ordering of its initial and boundary conditions. Future releases of TUFLOW FV will allow alternative methods for specification of initial and boundary conditions that do not rely on assumed ordering. In the interim however, the following applies. 4.4.2.3.1 Initial Conditions Initial conditions, if set using means other than a restart file, must be specified with water quality constituents in a preset order. Header information is not used in setting water quality initial conditions - the ordering of values or columns is the sole means by which text based initial conditions are set. For example, the following *.fvc command sets globally uniform initial conditions for a typical inorganics simulation class: initial wq concentration == 7.5, 0.0, 4.2, 10.5, 0.6, 5.5 There are no references to headers or variable names, but TUFLOW FV assumes that these numbers correspond to the ordered variables of the particular configuration of the inorganics simulation class returned to it from the WQM. In this example, this ordering is: Dissolved oxygen (7.5 mg/L) Silicate (0.0 mg/L) Ammonium (4.2 mg/L) Nitrate (10.5 mg/L) Free reactive phosphorus (0.6 mg/L), and One phytoplankton group (5.5 \\(\\mu\\)g/L) Similarly, the expected ordering of columns in profile, 2D or 3D options is the only means by which TUFLOW FV interprets initial conditions: headers in these files are ignored. The expected ordering is the same as that for boundary condition specifications, as described below. 4.4.2.3.2 Boundary Conditions Ordering of water quality boundary conditions is only important when specifying header information via the bc header == (or equivalent) command within a TUFLOW FV *.fvc file BC block. It is in these commands (where comma separated header strings are specified) that TUFLOW FV expects a particular order of TUFLOW FV and WQM constituents. No column ordering is expected in boundary condition data files themselves. Ordering is only expected in the order of headers specified within a BC block within an TUFLOW FV control file. This is best illustrated by example. If a user has elected to deploy the inorganics simulation class without sediment, then the following will be simulated (beyond the basic velocity and water level hydrodynamic variable suite): Salinity Temperature Dissolved oxygen Silicate Ammonium Nitrate Free reactive phosphorus One (assumed for this example, but can be multiple) phytoplankton group These will eventually need proper boundary condition specification in boundary condition blocks and have supporting data provided in (usually) text files. In a simple model with only one WL boundary condition, a bc block of the following form would be required as a minimum to properly specify the hydrodynamic and water quality boundaries: bc == WL, 1, datafile.csv \\(\\blockindent\\) bc header == time, wsel, sali, temp, DOxy, SiO4, NH41, nitr, frph, bluegreen end bc To be clear: The names listed on the bc header == line (time, wse etc.) are not keywords or special names, and can be any names that a user chooses TUFLOW FV will however, assume that these names (whatever they have been set to) have been listed in such an order that they have a one to one correspondence to the ten computed variables as follows: time \\(\\rightarrow\\) Time stamp wsel \\(\\rightarrow\\) Water surface elevation sali \\(\\rightarrow\\) Salinity temp \\(\\rightarrow\\) Temperature DOxy \\(\\rightarrow\\) Dissolved oxygen SiO4 \\(\\rightarrow\\) Silicate NH41 \\(\\rightarrow\\) Ammonium nitr \\(\\rightarrow\\) Nitrate frph \\(\\rightarrow\\) Free reactive phosphorus bluegreen \\(\\rightarrow\\) Phytoplankton group one TUFLOW then matches the user specified names to the expected simulation variables, based on this ordering, to then interrogate boundary condition files. Following the above matching, TUFLOW FV interrogates the relevant boundary condition file (datafile.csv in the example above), where this file can have its columns arranged in any order: the order of these columns does not matter because TUFLOW FV will use the mapping previously developed via the bc header == command to look through all data file columns one by one, searching for the headers specified, regardless of the actual ordering of boundary condition file columns. For example, the silicate boundary condition data could be positioned in column 14 of the boundary condition file, but as long as it is labelled with the correct header (SiO4 as specified in bc header ==), TUFLOW FV will know to assign column 14 of the boundary condition data file to the silicate computed variable. Ordering is set by the users selection of simulation class and constituent models, and is explicitly listed in each simulation class section (Sections 4.6.5, 4.7.5 and 4.8.5 for DO, inorganics and organics, respectively). The expected ordering for a particular simulation is also reported in the simulation water quality log file for checking. 4.5 Water quality control file commands The water quality control file comprises three parts, with each part containing different types of commands and flags. Whilst it is recommended that these parts be kept separate and in the order described below (especially given how complex water quality simulations can become), doing so is not mandatory and commands or command blocks may be entered in any order. These parts are as follows, with the first two mirroring the architecture described in Section 2: Simulation controls (i.e. simulation class) Constituent model settings (i.e. constituent model class) Material specifications Notwithstanding this, a WQM control file need not contain any commands, and can be completely blank. This is by design, and intended to allow users to rapidly set up and execute a TUFLOW water quality simulation. If the water quality control file is left blank, then the WQM will: Construct a simulation using the dissolved oxygen simulation class (which is the simplest class) Set the simulation units to mg/L Set library defaults for all parameters Set the water quality model timestep to the default Assign zero dissolved oxygen concentration to all boundary conditions. This is by design, and will assist in ensuring that the subsequent user-defined updating of boundary conditions is thorough and complete (zero dissolved oxygen boundary conditions are rare and therefore easily identifiable). Initial conditions will also need to be specified in the TUFLOW FV control file as per Section 4.4.2. Specification of boundary conditions can be deferred. The water quality control file sections are described below. Details specific to each simulation class and constituent model are provided in subsequent sections 4.5.1 Part 1: Simulation controls Simulation controls set the high level operation of the WQM and are not specific to a simulation class. All are optional. Available commands set the: Simulation class via simulation class == Timestep dt (in seconds) at which TUFLOW calls the WQM via wq dt == Units of simulation via wq units == A typical simulation control section might therefore look like the following: simulation class == DO wq dt == 600.0 wq units == mgl 4.5.2 Part 2: Constituent model settings Constituent model settings are those that: Specify the constituent model to be used within each preset constituent model class. These are referred to as constituent model blocks Set the parameters for each of these constituent models, as commands within these blocks All are optional, however if a constituent model block is initiated then it requires an end XXXX model command to terminate the block, where XXXX is the name of the constituent model class, such as nitrogen. An example of a user selecting to use the adsorbed free reactive phosphorous constituent model (that is a model available within the inorganic phosphorus constituent model class), and setting some parameters within that model is as follows: inorganic phosphorus model == frpads atmospheric deposition == 12.6, 0.5 end inorganic phosphorus model Parameters not specified by the user are set to library defaults. All constituent models allow for constraining (and then reporting) the predictions of their respective computed variable concentrations via the setting of minimum and maximum limits, if desired. This is often useful in identifying unusual model behaviours or instabilities. Where exceedences of these limits are identified by the WQM: Time and model cell information is written to the WQM log file in real time. This allows for easy identification of potential model issues via periodic examination of the WQM log file, rather than waiting for simulation completion The WQM resets the computed concentration to the relevant specified minimum or maximum concentration The above resetting will result in mass conservation errors. It should not be relied on in any circumstances to artificially control the behaviour of an otherwise unstable or runaway water quality simulation. Rather, this functionality should be used as a convenient way to check model performance and flag potential issues, with a view to then implementing corrective action. These limits are optionally specified in each constituent model block. An example that sets these limits for ammonium is: ammonium min max == 0.0, 25.0 Although in the strictest sense, sediment (benthic) flux half saturation concentrations and temperature coefficients are benthic properties, the WQM does not yet support these parameters being applied on a spatially varying basis (i.e. per material). As such, these are considered to be constituent model global parameters and so are set in this part of the water quality control file, i.e. within respective constituent model blocks. An example that sets an oxygen half saturation and temperature coefficient for benthic flux is: oxygen benthic == 5.0, 1.08 4.5.3 Part 3: Material specifications The final part of the water quality control file (*.fvwq) provides for specification of benthic (sediment) fluxes, via material blocks. The commands required to commence and terminate a materials block are as follows: material == &lt;up to 10 comma separated material numbers, or default&gt; and end material This material block nomenclature mirrors that used in the TUFLOW FV and sediment transport control files. An example of specifying oxygen and nitrate benthic fluxes for materials 2, 7 and 12 is: material == 2, 7, 12 oxygen flux == -60.0 nitrate flux == 12.5 end material The WQM allows for specification of a default set of benthic fluxes that are applied across all materials, by using the key word default instead of specifying material numbers in a material block. These defaults can then be progressively overwritten on a material by material basis by specifying subsequent material blocks. For example, a model that has ten materials in total, eight of which have the same oxygen benthic flux (all materials except 4 and 7), can have its overall oxygen benthic flux specified as: material == default oxygen flux == -60.0 end material material == 4, 7 oxygen flux == -20.0 end material 4.5.4 Summary In order to set up and execute a water quality simulation using TUFLOW WQM, the following steps are required: Modify the TUFLOW FV control file: Add at least the following commands to TUFLOW FV control file (*.fvc): water quality model == TUFLOW water quality control file == (water quality control file name).fvwq Optionally add a folder path command to the TUFLOW FV control file (*.fvc) with a trailing backslash: water quality model dir == &lt;relative path to *.fvwq file&gt;\\(\\backslash\\) Add appropriate initial conditions for all water quality constituents, observing ordering rules Initially optionally add boundary conditions for all water quality constituents, observing ordering rules in bc header == commands Create the water quality control file with the corresponding name and path Modify the water quality control file Optionally add to the water quality control file: Part 1: A simulation controls section Part 2: A constituent model setting section with one or more constituent model blocks with one or more parameter commands Part 3: A material block specifications section Once initially constructed, boundary conditions can be added (if not already in place), and progressive refinement and parameterisation of constituent models and benthic fluxes can be affected. Details of these commands and their options within each specific simulation class are provided in subsequent sections. Subsections are separated into the above water quality control file parts for ease and consistency of reference. All commands are optional. 4.6 Simulation Class: DO If no simulation class is specified then a simulation will be automatically constructed using this DO class, and populated with library defaults for all parameters. Computed variables will be: Dissolved oxygen 4.6.1 Prerequisites The DO simulation class requires simulation of the following in TUFLOW FV: Hydrodynamics, in either two or three dimensions (including any internal one dimensional structures if present) Salinity Temperature Heat module on (i.e. meteorological forcing is required) Simulation of suspended sediment (via TUFLOW FVs sediment transport module) is optional. 4.6.2 Part 1: Simulation specification The DO simulation class is set via simulation class == DO The other commands in this part are not specific to this simulation class. See section 4.5.1. 4.6.3 Part 2: Constituent model specification As per Tables 2.2 and 2.3, oxygen is the only constituent model class available within the DO simulation class, and there is only one oxygen constituent model within that class, with code O2. 4.6.3.1 Model class: Oxygen 4.6.3.1.1 Constituent model: O2 This constituent model is specified as: oxygen model == O2 Minimum and maximum concentrations are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen min max == \\(\\left[DO\\right]_{min}^{O_2}\\), \\(\\left[DO\\right]_{max}^{O_2}\\) Global benthic parameters (used in Equation (D.4)) are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen benthic == \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\), \\(\\theta_{sed}^{O_2}\\) Although not strictly necessary, the use of oxygen to prefix these block commands is deliberate so as to maintain consistency of command style with other constituent model blocks that include more than one computed variable, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and organics. Nonetheless, if the oxygen prefix is omitted within this constituent model block, the WQM will still interpret the above commands correctly. This constituent model block must be terminated using the command: end oxygen model 4.6.4 Part 3: Material specification Oxygen benthic flux (used in Equation (D.4)) is specified within both default and numbered material blocks as: \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen flux == \\(F_{sed}^{O_2}\\) 4.6.5 Constituent ordering Dissolved oxygen is the only constituent simulated by the WQM for this simulation class. In all columnar and list style initial conditions, oxygen concentration is specified as the first variable (shown in symbolic form below): initial wq concentration == \\(\\left[ DO \\right]\\) Similarly, in a bc header == command within a bc block, oxygen is expected to be the first and only water quality variable after hydrodynamic boundary conditions. \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == time, water_elev, sal, temp, clay, sand, DO_mgL DO_mgL is the header used to designate oxygen in the related boundary condition file, noting that the DO_mgL column in the boundary condition file can appear in any column in the boundary condition file, and that it does not need to be the seventh column. The header text DO_mgL is just an example, and it can be any header desired, as long as it matches the correct column header in the boundary condition file. 4.6.6 Example Following is an example of all the available WQM simulation class == DO commands. A single material applied as zeros everywhere as the default, other than for materials 1 and 4 where the default flux is overwritten. simulation class == DO wq dt == 3600 wq units == mgl oxygen model == O2 oxygen benthic == 4.0, 1.05 min max == 0.0, 15.0 end oxygen model material == default oxygen flux == 0 end material material == 1, 4 oxygen flux == -637.0 end material 4.7 Simulation Class: Inorganics If the inorganics simulation class is specified with no subsequent constituent model blocks, then a simulation will be automatically constructed using this inorganics class, and populated with library defaults for all parameters. Computed variables will be: Dissolved oxygen Silicate Ammonium Nitrate Free reactive phosphorus One phytoplankton group named dummy that uses the basic phytoplankton constituent model 4.7.1 Prerequisites The inorganics simulation class requires simulation of the following in TUFLOW FV: Hydrodynamics, in either two or three dimensions (including any internal one dimensional structures if present) Salinity Temperature Heat module on (i.e. meteorological forcing is required) Simulation of suspended sediment (via TUFLOW FVs sediment transport module) is required only if adsorbed phosphorus is to be simulated by the WQM. This is affected through specification of the adsorbed phosphorus constituent model within the phosphorus constituent model class. 4.7.2 Part 1: Simulation specification The inorganics simulation class is set via simulation class == inorganics The other commands in this part are not specific to this simulation class. See section 4.5.1. 4.7.3 Part 2: Constituent model specification As per Tables 2.2 and 2.3, there are several constituent model classes available within the inorganics simulation class. The commands for each are described following. 4.7.3.1 Model class: Oxygen 4.7.3.1.1 Constituent model: O2 The commands for this constituent model are described in Section 4.6.3.1.1. 4.7.3.2 Model class: Silicate 4.7.3.2.1 Constituent model: Si This constituent model is specified as: silicate model == Si Minimum and maximum concentrations are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) silicate min max == \\(\\left[Si\\right]_{min}^{Si}\\), \\(\\left[Si\\right]_{max}^{Si}\\) Global benthic flux parameters (used in Equation (E.1)) are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) silicate benthic == \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{Si}\\), \\(\\theta_{sed}^{Si}\\) Although not strictly necessary, the use of silicate to prefix the above block commands is deliberate so as to maintain consistency of command style with other constituent model blocks that include more than one computed variable, such as nitrogen, phosphorus and organics. Silicate sediment flux calculations are set to be dependent on dissolved oxygen concentrations by default. Although not recommended, the following will switch off this dependence by setting the term labelled Influence of oxygen in Equation (E.1) to a value of 1.0. \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen == off This constituent model block must be terminated using the command: end silicate model 4.7.3.3 Model class: Inorganic nitrogen 4.7.3.3.1 Constituent model: AmmoniumNitrate This constituent model is specified as: inorganic nitrogen model == AmmoniumNitrate Minimum and maximum concentrations for both ammonium and nitrate are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) ammonium min max == \\(\\left[NH_4\\right]_{min}^{NH_4}\\), \\(\\left[NH_4\\right]_{max}^{NH_4}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrate min max == \\(\\left[NO_3\\right]_{min}^{NO_3}\\), \\(\\left[NO_3\\right]_{max}^{NO_3}\\) Global benthic flux parameters (used in Equation (F.1)) for ammonium and nitrate are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) ammonium benthic == \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{NH_4}\\), \\(\\theta_{sed}^{NH_4}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrate benthic == \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{NO_3}\\), \\(\\theta_{sed}^{NO_3}\\) Nitrification parameters (used in (F.3) and therefore (F.4)) are set in a single command as: \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrification == \\(R_{nitrif}^{NH_4}\\), \\(K_{nitrif-O_2}^{NH_4}\\), \\(\\theta_{nitrif}^{NH_4}\\) Denitrification parameters (used in Equation (F.5) or Equation (F.6)) are also set in a single command as: \\(\\blockindent\\) denitrification == Michaelis Menten, \\(R_{denitrif}^{NO_3}\\), \\(K_{denitrif-O_2-MM}^{NO_3}\\), \\(\\theta_{denitrif}^{NO_3}\\) or \\(\\blockindent\\) denitrification == exponential, \\(R_{denitrif}^{NO_3}\\), \\(K_{denitrif-O_2-exp}^{NO_3}\\), \\(\\theta_{denitrif}^{NO_3}\\) The first argument (either michaelis menten or exponential) activates a different denitrification model (Equation (F.5) or Equation (F.6), respectively). Ammonium and nitrate sediment flux, nitrification and denitrification calculations are all set to be dependent on dissolved oxygen concentrations by default. Although not recommended, the following will switch off this dependence for all these processes by setting the term labelled Influence of oxygen in Equations (F.1), (F.3) and (F.5) or (F.6) to a value of 1.0. \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen == off This command overrides any previously specified values of \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{NH_4}\\), \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{NO_3}\\), \\(K_{nitrif-O_2}^{NH_4}\\), \\(K_{denitrif-O_2-MM}^{NO_3}\\) and \\(K_{denitrif-O_2-exp}^{NO_3}\\). It should be specified after all other related commands if the influence of oxygen on nitrogen processes is to be switched off. Atmospheric deposition parameters (used in Equations (F.8), (F.9), (F.12) and (F.13)) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) atmospheric deposition == \\(\\left[TN\\right]_{rain}\\), \\(R_{atm-dry}^{TN}\\), \\(f_{TN}^{NO_3}\\) The same split of TN into ammonium and nitrate is applied to both \\(\\left[TN\\right]_{rain}\\) and \\(R_{atm-dry}^{TN}\\). This constituent model block must be terminated using the command: end inorganic nitrogen model 4.7.3.4 Model class: Inorganic phosphorus 4.7.3.4.1 Constituent model: FRPhs This constituent model is specified as: inorganic phosphorus model == FRPhs Minimum and maximum concentrations for FRP are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) FRP min max == \\(\\left[FRP\\right]_{min}^{FRP}\\), \\(\\left[FRP\\right]_{max}^{FRP}\\) Global benthic flux parameters (used in Equation (G.1)) are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) FRP benthic == \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{FRP}\\), \\(\\theta_{sed}^{FRP}\\) FRP sediment flux calculations are set to be dependent on dissolved oxygen concentrations by default. Although not recommended, the following will switch off this dependence by setting the term labelled Influence of oxygen in Equation (G.1) to a value of 1.0. \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen == off Wet atmospheric deposition parameters (used in Equation (G.2)) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) atmospheric deposition == \\(\\left[FRP\\right]_{rain}\\) This constituent model block must be terminated using the command: end inorganic phosphorus model 4.7.3.4.2 Constituent model: FRPhsads This constituent model is specified as: inorganic phosphorus model == FRPhsads The TUFLOW FV sediment module (STM) must be used to simulate at least one sediment fraction in order to use this WQM constituent model. In addition to the commands described in Section 4.7.3.4.1, the following commands are available in this constituent model. Minimum and maximum concentrations for adsorbed FRP are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) FRP ads min max == \\(\\left[FRPads\\right]_{min}^{FRPads}\\), \\(\\left[FRPads\\right]_{max}^{FRPads}\\) Two FRP adsorption models are available, as per Equations (G.6) and (G.7). These require specification of two (linear) or three (quadratic) parameters, respectively after specification of the model to be used: \\(\\blockindent\\) adsorption == linear, \\(K_{ads-L}^{FRP}\\), \\(D50_{ads-max}^{FRP}\\) or \\(\\blockindent\\) adsorption == quadratic, \\(K_{ads-Q}^{FRP}\\), \\(Q_{max}^{FRP}\\), \\(D50_{ads-max}^{FRP}\\) Dry atmospheric deposition of FRP is activated in this simulation model (used in Equation (G.3)) and is specified via the same command as wet deposition, but with one additional argument. This additional argument is ignored if the FRPhsads constituent model has not been set: \\(\\blockindent\\) atmospheric deposition == \\(\\left[FRP\\right]_{rain}\\), \\(R_{atm-dry}^{FRP}\\) This constituent model block must be terminated using the command: end inorganic phosphorus model 4.7.3.5 Model class: Phytoplankton Given the large number of potential commands and options for phytoplankton simulation, horizontal rules have been used to separate subsections below for clarity. 4.7.3.5.1 Constituent model: Basic This constituent model is specified as: phyto model == basic, groupname groupname is any user specified phytoplankton group name that uses only alphanumeric characters with no spaces. Minimum and maximum concentrations for a phytoplankton group are specified as follows. No prefix keyword (as was the case for constituents such as ammonium) is required: \\(\\blockindent\\) min max == \\(\\left[PHY\\right]_{min}^{PHY}\\), \\(\\left[PHY\\right]_{max}^{PHY}\\) 4.7.3.5.1.1 Temperature limitation Temperature limitation can be specified by one of the following models: None (no temperature limitation applied) \\(\\blockindent\\) temperature limitation == none or Standard (used in Equations (J.1) through to (J.8)) \\(\\blockindent\\) temperature limitation == standard, \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\), \\(T_{opt}^{phy}\\), \\(T_{max}^{phy}\\) 4.7.3.5.1.2 Salinity limitation Salinity limitation can be specified by one of the following models: None (no salinity limitation applied) \\(\\blockindent\\) salinity limitation == none or Fresh (used in Equation (J.27)) \\(\\blockindent\\) salinity limitation == fresh, \\(S_{opt-fresh}^{phy}\\), \\(S_{max-fresh}^{phy}\\), \\(L_{max-fresh}^{phy}\\) or Marine (used in Equation (J.28)) \\(\\blockindent\\) salinity limitation == marine, \\(S_{opt-marine}^{phy}\\), \\(L_{zero}^{phy}\\) or Mixed (used in Equation (J.29)) \\(\\blockindent\\) salinity limitation == mixed, \\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\), \\(S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\), \\(L_{zero}^{phy}\\) or Estuarine (used in Equation (J.30)) \\(\\blockindent\\) salinity limitation == estuarine, \\(S_{opt-est}^{phy}\\), \\(S_{max-est}^{phy}\\), \\(P_{est}^{phy}\\) 4.7.3.5.1.3 Light limitation Light limitation can be specified by one of the following models: Basic (used in Equation (J.19)) \\(\\blockindent\\) light limitation == basic, \\(Ke^{phy}\\), \\(I_{K-bas}\\) or Monod (used in Equation (J.20)) \\(\\blockindent\\) light limitation == monod, \\(Ke^{phy}\\), \\(I_{K-mon}\\) or Steele (used in Equation (J.21)) \\(\\blockindent\\) light limitation == steele, \\(Ke^{phy}\\), \\(I_{S-ste}\\) or Webb (used in Equation (J.22)) \\(\\blockindent\\) light limitation == webb, \\(Ke^{phy}\\), \\(I_{K-web}\\) or Jassby (used in Equation (J.23)) \\(\\blockindent\\) light limitation == jassby, \\(Ke^{phy}\\), \\(I_{K-jas}\\) or Chalker (used in Equation (J.24)) \\(\\blockindent\\) light limitation == chalker, \\(Ke^{phy}\\), \\(I_{K-cha}\\) or Klepper (used in Equation (J.25)) \\(\\blockindent\\) light limitation == klepper, \\(Ke^{phy}\\), \\(I_{S-kle}\\) or Integrated (used in Equation (J.26)) \\(\\blockindent\\) light limitation == integrated, \\(Ke^{phy}\\), \\(I_{S-int}\\) 4.7.3.5.1.4 Nitrogen limitation Nitrogen limitation parameters (used in Equation (J.9), Section J.3.1) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrogen limitation == \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}^{phy}\\), \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) These, together with additional parameters, are the same as those used in specifying the nitrogen limitation behaviour of the advanced phytoplankton model (Section 4.7.3.5.2.1). 4.7.3.5.1.5 Phosphorus limitation Phosphorus limitation parameters (used in Equation (J.13), Section J.4.1) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) phosphorus limitation == \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}^{phy}\\), \\(K_{lim-P}^{phy}\\) These, together with additional parameters, are the same as those used in specifying the phosphorus limitation behaviour of the advanced phytoplankton model (Section 4.7.3.5.2.2). 4.7.3.5.1.6 Silicate limitation Silicate limitation parameters (used in Equation (J.17), Section J.5) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) silicate limitation == \\(\\left[Si\\right]_{min}^{phy}\\), \\(K_{lim-Si}^{phy}\\) Specification of this limitation triggers the uptake of silicate to be on in the phytoplankton groups block in which the command appears. Omit this command to set silicate uptake to off for a given phytoplankton group. 4.7.3.5.1.7 Uptake Nutrient uptake parameters for nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate (if relevant) (used in Equations (K.2), (K.7) and (K.9) respectively) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) uptake == \\(X_{N-C-con}^{phy}\\), \\(X_{P-C-con}^{phy}\\), \\(X_{Si-C-con}^{phy}\\) If specified, the value of \\(X_{Si-C-con}^{phy}\\) is ignored if silicate uptake has not been triggered via specification of silicate limitation parameters via silicate limitation ==. 4.7.3.5.1.8 Primary productivity Primary productivity (growth) parameters (used in Equation (I.2)) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) primary productivity == \\(R_{prod}^{phy}\\), \\(\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\) 4.7.3.5.1.9 Respiration Respiration parameters are set via the following command. The first two parameters are used directly to compute the respiration rate \\(R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) via Equation (I.6). The third and fourth parameters are used to compute excretive and mortality fluxes in Equations (L.1) and (L.2), respectively. Both these equations use the respiration rate computed from the first two parameters \\(R_{resp}^{phy}\\) and \\(\\theta_{resp}^{phy}\\). Although not strictly related to respiration, the final parameter does represent a reduction of biomass and is used to compute exudation loss using Equation (I.10). \\(\\blockindent\\) respiration == \\(R_{resp}^{phy}\\), \\(\\theta_{resp}^{phy}\\), \\(f_{true-resp}^{phy}\\), \\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\\), \\(f_{exud}^{phy}\\) 4.7.3.5.1.10 Carbon to Chlorophyll a ratio The carbon to chlorophyll a ratio (used in converting between simulation units, and reporting total chlorophyll a as a diagnostic variable if the mmol units system is used) is specified via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) carbon chla ratio == \\(X_{cc}^{phy}\\) 4.7.3.5.1.11 Nitrogen fixing Nitrogen fixing parameters are specified as follows. The first parameter is used in Equation (K.2) to compute the nitrogen fixation flux, and the second parameter modifies computed primary productivity via Equation (I.3). \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrogen fixing == \\(R_{nfix}^{N_2}\\), \\(f_{nfix}^{phy}\\) Setting this command triggers nitrogen fixing to be on, otherwise it is off by default. 4.7.3.5.1.12 Settling Settling can be specified by one of the following models: None \\(\\blockindent\\) settling == none or Constant \\(\\blockindent\\) settling == constant, \\(V_{settle}^{phy}\\) or Constant with density correction (as per Equation (I.12)) \\(\\blockindent\\) settling == thermal, \\(V_{settle}^{phy}\\) or Stokes (used in Equation (I.13)), where density is required to be simulated as a computed variable, and thus requires the specification of \\(I_K\\). \\(\\blockindent\\) settling == stokes, \\(I_{K-sto}\\) If \\(I_K\\) is specified in any light limitation model applied to a phytoplankton group with stokes settling, then a value of \\(I_{K-sto}\\) specified in the stokes model will be ignored. Cell density limits are applied as the defaults and are not user specifiable. 4.7.3.5.1.13 Termination This constituent model block must be terminated using the command: end phyto model 4.7.3.5.2 Constituent model: Advanced This constituent model is specified as: phyto model == advanced, groupname groupname is any user specified phytoplankton group name that uses only alphanumeric characters with no spaces. The following commands are the same as those described for the basic phytoplankton model in Section 4.7.3.5.1: \\(\\blockindent\\) min max == \\(\\blockindent\\) temperature limitation == \\(\\blockindent\\) light limitation == \\(\\blockindent\\) silicate limitation == \\(\\blockindent\\) primary productivity == \\(\\blockindent\\) respiration == \\(\\blockindent\\) carbon chla ratio == \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrogen fixing == \\(\\blockindent\\) settling == end phyto model The following commands differ for the advanced phytoplankton model compared to the basic model. 4.7.3.5.2.1 Nitrogen limitation Nitrogen limitation parameters (used in Equation (J.11), Section J.3.2) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrogen limitation == \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}^{phy}\\), \\(K_{N}^{phy}\\), \\(X_{N-C-min}^{phy}\\), \\(X_{N-C-max}^{phy}\\) The first two parameters are the same as those that would be specified using the same command in the basic phytoplankton model (Section 4.7.3.5.1.4). 4.7.3.5.2.2 Phosphorus limitation Phosphorus limitation parameters (used in Equation (J.15), Section J.4.2) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) phosphorus limitation == \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}^{phy}\\), \\(K_{P}^{phy}\\), \\(X_{P-C-min}^{phy}\\), \\(X_{P-C-max}^{phy}\\) The first two parameters are the same as those that would be specified using the same command in the basic phytoplankton model (Section 4.7.3.5.1.5). 4.7.3.5.2.3 Uptake Nutrient uptake parameters for nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate (if relevant) (used in Equations (K.4), (K.8) and (K.9) respectively) are set via the command: \\(\\blockindent\\) uptake == \\(R_{upt-N}^{phy}\\), \\(R_{upt-P}^{phy}\\), \\(X_{Si-C-con}^{phy}\\) The value of \\(X_{Si-C-con}^{phy}\\) is ignored if silicate uptake has not been triggered through specification of a silicate limitation function. 4.7.3.5.2.4 Settling An additional settling model can be specified in the advanced phytoplankton constituent model as: Motile (Section I.4.5), where internal nutrient simulation is required to simulate motility \\(\\blockindent\\) settling == motile, \\(V_{mot}^{phy}\\), \\(I_{K-mot}\\) If \\(I_K\\) is specified in any light limitation model applied to an advanced constituent model phytoplankton group with motile settling, then a value of \\(I_{K-mot}\\) specified in the motile model will be ignored. Cell density limits are applied as the defaults and are not user specifiable. 4.7.4 Part 3: Material specification Oxygen, silicate, ammonium, nitrate and FRP benthic fluxes are specified within both default and numbered material blocks as: \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen flux == \\(F_{sed}^{O_2}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) silicate flux == \\(F_{sed}^{sil}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) ammonium flux == \\(F_{sed}^{NH_4}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrate flux == \\(F_{sed}^{NO_3}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) FRP flux == \\(F_{sed}^{FRP}\\) No adsorbed FRP or phytoplankton sediment fluxes are required. 4.7.5 Constituent ordering Different constituent model selections result in different ordering requirements for specifying computed variable initial conditions and bc header == commands. For clarity, these are initially presented below using only phytoplankton placeholders in lists. This is possible because phytoplankton specifications are always appended at the end of initial condition or bc header == lists. Phytoplankton specifications are then presented as additive to these lists in subsequent sections. This is not meant to imply that phytoplankton simulation is optional in the inorganics simulation class - it is mandatory and has only been described separately here for clarity of presentation. 4.7.5.1 Excluding phytoplankton The only constituent model choice that influences ordering (other than phytoplankton) is the phosphorus model. These two possibilities are described below. 4.7.5.1.1 Phosphorus model FRPhs If adsorbed FRP is not simulated (i.e. phosphorus model == FRPhs), then in all columnar and list style initial conditions, computed variables are expected in the following order: initial wq concentration == \\(\\left[ DO \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ Si \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ NH_4 \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ NO_3 \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ FRP \\right]\\), \\(\\ldots\\) {phytoplankton placeholder/s} Similarly, in a bc header == command within a bc block, the following order of computed variables is expected after hydrodynamic (HD BCs) boundary conditions: \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL, \\(\\ldots\\) {phytoplankton placeholder/s} With regard to the abovebc header == command: DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL and FRP_mgL are the headers used to designate oxygen, silicate, ammonium, nitrate and FRP in the related boundary condition file, respectively Whilst this ordering in the command is fixed, the corresponding columnar data can appear in any order in the associated boundary condition file The header texts DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL and FRP_mgL are not special keywords. They can be any headers desired, as long as they match the correct respective boundary condition file column headers 4.7.5.1.2 Phosphorus model FRPhsads If adsorbed FRP is simulated (i.e. phosphorus model == FRPhsads), then in all columnar and list style initial conditions, computed variables are expected in the following order: initial wq concentration == \\(\\left[ DO \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ Si \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ NH_4 \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ NO_3 \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ FRP \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ FRPads \\right]\\), \\(\\ldots\\) {phytoplankton placeholder/s} Similarly, in a bc header == command within a bc block, the following order of computed variables is expected after hydrodynamic boundary conditions: \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL, FRP_ads_mgL, \\(\\ldots\\) {phytoplankton placeholder/s} With regard to the abovebc header == command: DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL and FRP_ads_mgL are the headers used to designate oxygen, silicate, ammonium, nitrate, FRP and adsorbed FRP in the related boundary condition file, respectively Whilst this ordering in the command is fixed, the corresponding columnar data can appear in any order in the associated boundary condition file The header texts DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL and FRP_ads_mgLare not special keywords. They can be any headers desired, as long as they match the correct respective boundary condition file column headers 4.7.5.2 Including phytoplankton Phytoplankton initial conditions and bc header == fields are appended directly to the above computed variable specifications, as denoted by the {phytoplankton placeholder/s} flag above. Each phytoplankton group is specified using a cluster of values (initial conditions) or headers (bc block) and these clusters must appear in the same order as phytoplankton groups are specified in the water quality control file. The content of each phytoplankton cluster is determined both by the phytoplankton constituent model used and the settling model selected. These are described below, using a placeholder for preceding (non-phytoplankton) computed variables for clarity. These are described above and can be interpreted as either of the orderings specified in sections 4.7.5.1.1 or 4.7.5.1.2. Two phytoplankton groups are used in all examples. 4.7.5.2.1 Phytoplankton model basic If the basic phytoplankton constituent model is used, then in all columnar and list style initial conditions, computed variables are expected in the following order: initial wq concentration == {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_1]}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_2]}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) In order to match water quality control file groups with initial conditions, it is assumed that the groups clusters of initial conditions are specified above in the same order that phyto model == blocks are presented in the water quality control file. Similarly, in a bc header == command within a bc block, the following order of computed variables is expected after hydrodynamic and non-phytoplankton boundary conditions: \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_green}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_bluegreen}}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) With regard to the abovebc header == command: phyto_green and phyto_bluegreen are the headers used to designate the boundary concentrations of the two phytoplankton groups listed in the water quality control file In order to match water quality control file groups with these boundary condition clusters, it is assumed that the groups boundary condition header clusters are specified above in the same order that phyto model == blocks appear in the water quality control file Although the names listed in the bc header == command above do not need to match the names listed in the water quality control file phytoplankton blocks, it is recommended that they do have names that are correlated with the phytoplankton group names in the water quality control file, for model integrity Whilst this ordering in the command is fixed, the corresponding columnar data can appear in any order in the associated boundary condition file The header texts phyto_green and phyto_bluegreen are not special keywords. They can be any headers desired, as long as they match the correct respective boundary condition file column headers If the command settling == stokes is used for a phytoplankton group, then phytoplankton cell density must be simulated as a computed variable that requires initial and boundary conditions. This therefore affects the clustering of phytoplankton initial and boundary conditions. For example, if the first (and not the second) phytoplankton group above used the stokes settling model, then the following initial condition command would be required: \\(\\blockindent\\)initial wq concentration == {HD} \\(\\ldots\\) {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_1],\\rho_{phy1}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_2]}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) \\(\\rho_{phy1}\\) is the initial density of the first phytoplankton groups cells. A density initial condition is not required for the second phytoplankton species because it does not use stokes settling. Similarly, in a bc header == command within a bc block, the following order of computed variables is expected after hydrodynamic and non-phytoplankton boundary conditions: \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_green, phyto_green_density}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_bluegreen}}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) If both phytoplankton groups simulated density then the corresponding initial condition and boundary condition commands would be as follows: \\(\\blockindent\\)initial wq concentration == {HD} \\(\\ldots\\) {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_1],\\rho_{phy1}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_2],\\rho_{phy2} }_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_green, phyto_green_density}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_bluegreen, phyto_bluegreen_density}}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) \\(\\rho_{phy1}\\) and \\(\\rho_{phy1}\\) are the initial densities of the first and second phytoplankton groups cells. The same notes provided above apply to these commands. 4.7.5.2.2 Phytoplankton model advanced If the advanced phytoplankton constituent model is used, then in all columnar and list style initial conditions, computed variables are expected in the following order: initial wq concentration == {non-phytoplankton placeholderss} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_1],[N_1]_{in},[P_1]_{in}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_2],[N_2]_{in},[P_2]_{in}}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) In order to match water quality control file groups with initial conditions, it is assumed that the groups initial conditions are specified above in the same order that phyto model == blocks are presented in the water quality control file. Similarly, in a bc header == command within a bc block, the following order of computed variables is expected after hydrodynamic and non-phytoplankton boundary conditions: \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_gr, gr_intN, gr_intP}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_blgr, blgr_intN, blgr_intP}}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) With regard to the abovebc header == command: phyto_gr and phyto_blgr are the headers used to designate the boundary concentrations of the two phytoplankton groups listed in the water quality control file gr_intN and gr_intP are the headers used to designate the boundary concentrations of internal nitrogen and internal phosphorus for the green phytoplankton group, respectively blgr_intN and blgr_intP are the headers used to designate the boundary concentrations of internal nitrogen and internal phosphorus for the bluegreen group, respectively In order to match water quality control file groups with these boundary conditions, it is assumed that the groups boundary condition header clusters are specified above in the same order that phyto model == blocks appear in the water quality control file Although the names listed in the bc header == command above do not need to match the names listed in the water quality control file phytoplankton blocks, it is recommended that they do have names that are correlated with the phytoplankton group names in the water quality control file, for model integrity Whilst this ordering in the command is fixed, the corresponding columnar data can appear in any order in the associated boundary condition file The header texts phyto_gr and phyto_blgr are not special keywords. They can be any headers desired, as long as they match the correct respective boundary condition file column headers If the command settling == stokes is used for a phytoplankton group, then phytoplankton cell density must be simulated as a computed variable that requires initial and boundary conditions. This therefore affects the clustering of phytoplankton initial and boundary conditions. If the first phytoplankton group above used the advanced phytoplankton model with the stokes settling model, and the second group used the basic phytoplankton model without stokes settling, then the following commands would be required: initial wq concentration == {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_1],\\rho_{phy_1},[N_1]_{in},[P_1]_{in}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_2]}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) Similarly, in a bc header == command within a bc block, the following order of computed variables is expected after hydrodynamic and non-phytoplankton boundary conditions: \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_gr, gr_dens, gr_intN, gr_intP}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_blgr}}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) If both phytoplankton groups simulated density, again with the first and second groups using the advanced and basic models respectively, then the corresponding commands would be as follows: initial wq concentration == {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_1],\\rho_{phy_1},[N_1]_{in},[P_1]_{in}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{[PHY_2],\\rho_{phy_2}}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) {non-phytoplankton placeholders} \\(\\ldots\\) \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_gr, gr_dens, gr_intN, gr_intP}}_{\\text{Cluster 1}}\\), \\(\\underbrace{\\text{phyto_blgr, blgr_dens}}_{\\text{Cluster 2}}\\) The same notes provided above apply to these commands. 4.7.6 Example Following is an example of all the available WQM simulation class == inorganics commands, with a single material applied as zeros everywhere as the default, and then modified by a further specification for materials 3 and 7. Two phytoplankton groups (one each of the basic and advanced models) are set. simulation class == inorganics wq dt == 3600 wq units == mgl oxygen model == O2 benthic == 4.0, 1.05 min max == 0.0, 25.0 end oxygen model silicate model == si benthic == 4.0, 1.05 min max == 0.0, 2500.0 oxygen == on end silicate model inorganic nitrogen model == AmmoniumNitrate ammonium benthic == 4.0, 1.05 nitrate benthic == 4.0, 1.05 ammonium min max == 0.0, 150.0 nitrate min max == 0.0, 250.0 nitrification == 0.1, 4.0, 1.05 denitrification == exponential, 0.5, 8.0, 1.05 atmospheric deposition == 10.0, 2.4, 0.15 oxygen == on end inorganic nitrogen model inorganic phosphorus model == frphsads frp benthic == 4.0, 1.05 frp min max == 0.0, 150.0 frpads min max == 0.0, 150.0 atmospheric deposition == 5.0, 1.4 adsorption == quadratic, 1.5, 0.5, 0.00005 oxygen == on end inorganic phosphorus model phyto model == basic, green min max == 0.01, 40.0 temperature limitation == standard, 11.0, 14.0, 30.0 salinity limitation == none light limitation == monod, 0.3, 70.0 settling == constant, 0.01 nitrogen limitation == 0.01, 1.5 phosphorus limitation == 0.001, 0.03 silicate limitation == 0.5, 7.0 uptake == 4.7, 0.6, 8.9 carbon chla ratio == 32.0 primary productivity == 2.0, 1.06 respiration == 0.02, 1.04, 0.1, 0.05, 0.6 end phyto model phyto model == advanced, bluegreen min max == 0.5, 50.0 temperature limitation == standard, 10.0, 15.0, 25.0 salinity limitation == estuarine, 22.0, 35.0, 0.0 light limitation == monod, 0.5, 51.0 settling == motile, 0.5 nitrogen limitation == 0.05, 2.5, 4.0, 5.0 phosphorus limitation == 0.01, 0.05, 0.64, 0.67 silicate limitation == 1.0, 5.0 uptake == 0.05, 0.05, 8.9 carbon chla ratio == 27.0 nitrogen fixing == 0.100, 0.100 primary productivity == 1.0, 1.08 respiration == 0.01, 1.01, 0.2, 0.0, 0.4 end phyto model material == default oxygen flux == 0.0 silicate flux == 0.0 ammonium flux == 0.0 nitrate flux == 0.0 frp flux == 0.0 end material material == 3, 7 oxygen flux == -4800.0 silicate flux == 122.0 ammonium flux == 37.0 nitrate flux == 3.7 frp flux == 1.4 end material 4.8 Simulation Class: Organics If the organics simulation class is specified with no subsequent constituent model blocks, then a simulation will be automatically constructed using this organics class, and populated with library defaults for all parameters. Computed variables will be: Dissolved oxygen Silicate Ammonium Nitrate Free reactive phosphorus Dissolved organic carbon Particulate organic carbon Dissolved organic nitrogen Particulate organic nitrogen Dissolved organic phosphorus Particulate organic phosphorus One phytoplankton group named dummy that uses the basic phytoplankton constituent model For clarity, this section uses acronyms for some computed variable names, and these acronyms are expanded in Appendix O. All references below to organic matter are to labile organic computed variables, unless specifically termed as refractory. 4.8.1 Prerequisites The organics simulation class requires simulation of the following in TUFLOW FV: Hydrodynamics, in either two or three dimensions (including any internal one dimensional structures if present) Salinity Sediment module on, with each particulate organic computed variables settling and resuspension properties being parameterised in the TUFLOW FV sediment module (see Section XXXX) Temperature Heat module on (i.e. meteorological forcing is required) Simulation of suspended sediment (via TUFLOW FVs sediment transport module) is required only if adsorbed phosphorus is to be simulated by the WQM. 4.8.2 Part 1: Simulation specification The organics simulation class is set via simulation class == organics The other commands in this part are not specific to this simulation class. See section 4.5.1. 4.8.3 Part 2: Constituent model specification As per Tables 2.2 and 2.3, there are several constituent model classes available within the organics simulation class. The commands for each are described following. To avoid repetition, cross references to explanations are provided for commands that are included in previous simulation classes and remain the same for this class. 4.8.3.1 Model class: Oxygen 4.8.3.1.1 Constituent model: O2 The commands for this constituent model are described in Section 4.7.3.1.1. 4.8.3.2 Model class: Silicate 4.8.3.2.1 Constituent model: Si The commands for this constituent model are described in Section 4.7.3.2.1. 4.8.3.3 Model class: Inorganic nitrogen 4.8.3.3.1 Constituent model: AmmoniumNitrate The commands for this constituent model are described in Section 4.7.3.3.1. 4.8.3.4 Model class: Inorganic phosphorus 4.8.3.4.1 Constituent model: FRPhs The commands for this constituent model are described in Section 4.7.3.4.1. 4.8.3.4.2 Constituent model: FRPhsads The commands for this constituent model are described in Section 4.7.3.4.2. 4.8.3.5 Model class: Organic matter 4.8.3.5.1 Constituent model: Labile This constituent model is specified as: organic matter model == labile Minimum and maximum concentrations are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) carbon min max == \\(\\left[POC\\right]_{min}^{POC}\\), \\(\\left[POC\\right]_{max}^{POC}\\), \\(\\left[DOC\\right]_{min}^{DOC}\\), \\(\\left[DOC\\right]_{max}^{DOC}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrogen min max == \\(\\left[PON\\right]_{min}^{PON}\\), \\(\\left[PON\\right]_{max}^{PON}\\), \\(\\left[DON\\right]_{min}^{DON}\\), \\(\\left[DON\\right]_{max}^{DON}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) phosphorus min max == \\(\\left[POP\\right]_{min}^{POP}\\), \\(\\left[POP\\right]_{max}^{POP}\\), \\(\\left[DOP\\right]_{min}^{DOP}\\), \\(\\left[DOP\\right]_{max}^{DOP}\\) Global benthic flux parameters (used in Equation (N.1)) are specified as: \\(\\blockindent\\) organics benthic == \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{DOM}\\), \\(\\theta_{sed}^{DOM}\\) Although not strictly necessary, the use of organics to prefix the above block command is deliberate so as to maintain consistency of command style with other constituent model blocks that include more than one computed variable, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The command will also be accepted simply as benthic ==. Particulate organic hydrolysis parameters (used in (N.2) and therefore (N.3)) are set in a single command as: \\(\\blockindent\\) hydrolysis == \\(R_{hyd}^{POC}\\), \\(R_{hyd}^{PON}\\), \\(R_{hyd}^{POP}\\), \\(K_{hyd-O_2}^{POM}\\), \\(\\theta_{hyd}^{POM}\\) Dissolved organic mineralisation parameters (used in (N.8) and therefore (N.9)) are set in a single command as: \\(\\blockindent\\) mineralisation == \\(R_{miner}^{DOM}\\), \\(K_{miner-O_2}^{DOM}\\), \\(\\theta_{miner}^{DOM}\\) Denitrification of nitrate due to anaerobic mineralisation of dissolved organic carbon parameters (used in Equations (N.10) and (N.16)) are set in a single command as: \\(\\blockindent\\) denitrification == \\(f_{an}\\), \\(K_{miner-NO_3}^{NO_3}\\) Self shading due to the presence of labile organics (used in Equation (N.27)) parameters are set as: \\(\\blockindent\\) self shading == \\(Ke^{POM}\\), \\(Ke^{DOM}\\) This constituent model block must be terminated using the command: end organic matter model 4.8.3.5.2 Constituent model: Refractory This constituent model encompasses all the functionality (and commands) of the labile organic matter constituent model, but offers further commands to simulate refractory organic processes, and their interaction with labile organic and inorganic computed variables. This constituent model is specified as: organic matter model == refractory Minimum and maximum concentrations are specified as follows. The carbon command includes the specification of refractory particulate organic matter minimums and maximums, as well as dissolved refractories. \\(\\blockindent\\) ref carbon min max == \\(\\left[RPOM\\right]_{min}^{RPOM}\\), \\(\\left[RPOM\\right]_{max}^{RPOM}\\), \\(\\left[RDOC\\right]_{min}^{RDOC}\\), \\(\\left[RDOC\\right]_{max}^{RDOC}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) ref nitrogen min max == \\(\\left[RDON\\right]_{min}^{RDON}\\), \\(\\left[RDON\\right]_{max}^{RDON}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) ref phosphorus min max == \\(\\left[RDOP\\right]_{min}^{RDOP}\\), \\(\\left[RDOP\\right]_{max}^{RDOP}\\) The breakdown of refractory particulate organic matter into labile particulate organic matter (used in Equations (N.5) and (N.6)) parameters are set as: \\(\\blockindent\\) ref breakdown == \\(R_{bdn}^{RPOM}\\), \\(X_N^{RPOM}\\), \\(X_P^{RPOM}\\) The activation of refractory dissolved organic matter to labile dissolved organic matter (used in Equations (N.18) and (N.19)) parameter is set as: \\(\\blockindent\\) ref activation == \\(R_{act}^{RDOM}\\) The photolysis of refractory organics (used in Equation (N.28)) parameter is set as: \\(\\blockindent\\) ref photolysis == \\(f_{photo}^{RDOM}\\) Self shading due to the presence of refractory organics (used in Equation (N.28)) parameters are set as: \\(\\blockindent\\) ref self shading == \\(Ke^{RPOM}\\), \\(R_{CDOM}^{RDOM}\\) This constituent model block must be terminated using the command: end organic matter model 4.8.3.6 Model class: Phytoplankton 4.8.3.6.1 Constituent model: Basic The commands for this constituent model are described in Section 4.7.3.5.1. 4.8.3.6.2 Constituent model: Advanced The commands for this constituent model are described in Section 4.7.3.5.2. 4.8.4 Part 3: Material specification Oxygen, silicate, ammonium, nitrate FRP, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen and dissolved organic phosphorus benthic fluxes are specified within both default and numbered material blocks as: \\(\\blockindent\\) oxygen flux == \\(F_{sed}^{O_2}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) silicate flux == \\(F_{sed}^{sil}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) ammonium flux == \\(F_{sed}^{NH_4}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) nitrate flux == \\(F_{sed}^{NO_3}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) FRP flux == \\(F_{sed}^{FRP}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) DOC flux == \\(F_{sed}^{DOC}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) DON flux == \\(F_{sed}^{DON}\\) \\(\\blockindent\\) DOP flux == \\(F_{sed}^{DOP}\\) No adsorbed FRP or phytoplankton fluxes are required. 4.8.5 Constituent ordering As for the inorganics simulation class (see Section 4.7.5) different organic matter constituent model selections require different orderings in specifying computed variable initial conditions and bc header == commands. Notwithstanding this, all the ordering information presented in Section 4.7.5 for the inorganics simulation class applies equally to the organics simulation class, other than for insertions related to the simulation of organics (described below). As such, that section should be reviewed with regard to ordering of the following: Dissolved oxygen Silicate Inorganic nitrogen Inorganic phosphorus (including the optional simulation of adsorbed FRP), and Phytoplankton groups (including the basic and advanced phytoplankton constituent models, with and without simulation of cell density) The additional initial condition and bc header == fields related to the organics simulation class do not change the order of computed variable fields presented in Section 4.7.5 other than to insert organic matter constituent model computed variables immediately after FRP computed variables and immediately prior to required phytoplankton fields. This insertion and ordering is presented following for the labile and refractory organic matter constituent models. 4.8.5.1 Labile The computed variables required to be specified within the labile organic matter constituent model are, in order: Dissolved organic carbon Particulate organic carbon Dissolved organic nitrogen Particulate organic nitrogen Dissolved organic phosphorus Particulate organic phosphorus All columnar and list style initial condition computed variables are therefore expected in the following order initial wq concentration == \\(\\left[ DO \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ Si \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ NH_4 \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ NO_3 \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ FRP \\right]\\), (optionally \\(\\left[ FRPads \\right]\\)), \\(\\left[ DOC \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ POC \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ DON \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ PON \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ DOP \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ POP \\right]\\), \\(\\ldots\\) {phytoplankton placeholder/s} Similarly, in a bc header == command within a bc block, the following order of computed variables is expected after hydrodynamic (HD BCs) boundary conditions: \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL, (optionally FRPads_mgL), DOC_mgL, POC_mgL, DON_mgL, PON_mgL, DOP_mgL, POP_mgL, \\(\\ldots\\) {phytoplankton placeholder/s} With regard to the abovebc header == command: DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL (optionally FRPads_mgL), DOC_mgL, POC_mgL, DON_mgL, PON_mgL, DOP_mgL and POP_mgL are the headers used to designate oxygen, silicate, ammonium, nitrate, FRP (optionally adsorbed FRP), dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, particulate organic nitrogen, dissolved organic phosphorus and particulate organic phosphorus in the related boundary condition file, respectively Whilst this ordering in the command is fixed, the corresponding columnar data can appear in any order in the associated boundary condition file The header texts DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL (optionally FRPads_mgL), DOC_mgL, POC_mgL, DON_mgL, PON_mgL, DOP_mgL and POP_mgL are not special keywords. They can be any headers desired, as long as they match the correct respective boundary condition file column headers 4.8.5.2 Refractory The computed variables required to be specified within the labile organic matter constituent model are, in order: Dissolved organic carbon Particulate organic carbon Dissolved organic nitrogen Particulate organic nitrogen Dissolved organic phosphorus Particulate organic phosphorus Refractory dissolved organic carbon Refractory dissolved organic nitrogen Refractory dissolved organic phosphorus Refractory particulate organic matter All columnar and list style initial condition computed variables are therefore expected in the following order initial wq concentration == \\(\\left[ DO \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ Si \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ NH_4 \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ NO_3 \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ FRP \\right]\\), (optionally \\(\\left[ FRPads \\right]\\)), \\(\\left[ DOC \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ POC \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ DON \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ PON \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ DOP \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ POP \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ RDOC \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ RDON \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ RDOP \\right]\\), \\(\\left[ RPOM \\right]\\), \\(\\ldots\\) {phytoplankton placeholder/s} Similarly, in a bc header == command within a bc block, the following order of computed variables is expected after hydrodynamic (HD BCs) boundary conditions: \\(\\blockindent\\)bc header == {HD BCs} \\(\\ldots\\) DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL, (optionally FRPads_mgL), DOC_mgL, POC_mgL, DON_mgL, PON_mgL, DOP_mgL, POP_mgL, RDOC_mgL, RDON_mgL, RDOP_mgL, RPOM_mgL, \\(\\ldots\\) {phytoplankton placeholder/s} With regard to the abovebc header == command: DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL (optionally FRPads_mgL), DOC_mgL, POC_mgL, DON_mgL, PON_mgL, DOP_mgL, POP_mgL, RDOC_mgL, RDON_mgL, RDOP_mgL and RPOM_mgL are the headers used to designate oxygen, silicate, ammonium, nitrate, FRP (optionally adsorbed FRP), dissolved organic carbon, particulate organic carbon, dissolved organic nitrogen, particulate organic nitrogen, dissolved organic phosphorus, particulate organic phosphorus, refractory dissolved organic carbon, refractory dissolved nitrogen, refractory dissolved phosphorus and refractory particulate organic matter in the related boundary condition file, respectively Whilst this ordering in the command is fixed, the corresponding columnar data can appear in any order in the associated boundary condition file The header texts DO_mgL, Si_mgL, Amm_mgL, Nit_mgL, FRP_mgL (optionally FRPads_mgL), DOC_mgL, POC_mgL, DON_mgL, PON_mgL, DOP_mgL, POP_mgL, RDOC_mgL, RDON_mgL, RDOP_mgL and RPOM_mgL are not special keywords. They can be any headers desired, as long as they match the correct respective boundary condition file column headers 4.8.6 Example Following is an example of all the available WQM simulation class == organics commands, with a single material applied as zeros everywhere as the default, and then modified by a further specification for materials 3 and 7.

Available outputs include: WQM outputs: Computed variables, i.e. time varying concentrations of simulated quantities (e.g. dissolved oxygen). See Appendix @(AppConstits) Diagnostic variables, i.e. time varying quantities that describe rates, and similar such processes which modify computed variables (e.g. sediment flux of nitrate). See Appendix P TUFLOW FV integrated outputs of WQM variables: Fluxes, e.g. the time varying flux of a WQM computed variable integrated by TUFLOW FV across a two dimensional vertical curtain, and Masses, e.g. the time varying integrated mass of a WQM computed or diagnostic variable, computed across the entire model domain Computed and diagnostic variables are output directly by the WQM, whilst integrated outputs are computed by TUFLOW FV, using WQM computed and diagnostic variables as inputs. All these types of outputs use the same structures as described in the TUFLOW FV user manual for hydrodynamic and other TUFLOW FV outputs, namely via specification of output == blocks. The relevant sections of the TUFLOW FV manual should be reviewed to supplement the material presented here. WQM and TUFLOW FV outputs are described below. 4.9.1 WQM outputs All WQM output computed and diagnostic variables, together with their output names, are included in Appendices O and P. The listed output names can be copied and pasted directly from the Appendices to a control file, with the exception of phytoplankton variables, where the user specified group name is included within the variable name, so will need to be inserted by the user. The most common output == blocks used by the WQM to report the time variation of computed and/or diagnostic variables are: 0D points: output == points 1D profiles: output == profiles 2D maps: output == datv 3D fields: output == netcdf The simplest manner in which to specify the computed and diagnostic variables to be included in these blocks is to use the wq_all and wq_diag_all flags against the output parameters command. An example of a 3D netcdf output block that reports computed variables (wq_all) and diagnostic variables (wq_diag_all) every hour is: output == netcdf output parameters == wq_all, wq_diag_all output interval == 3600.00 end output WQM outputs need not be in distinct output blocks of their own, but can be added to existing TUFLOW output blocks, for example: output == datv output parameters == h, V, wq_all, wq_diag_all output interval == 3600.00 vertical averaging == depth-all end output Water quality outputs are often voluminous. In order to avoid potentially cumbersome data handling issues around large output files, the output parameters == command arguments can be tailored to list only those computed or diagnostic variables required for analysis, rather than using the blanket wq_all and wq_diag_all arguments. An example of such an output command block that only reports dissolved oxygen concentration and atmospheric oxygen exchange is: output == netcdf output parameters == h, WQ_DISS_OXYGEN_MGL, WQ_DIAG_O2_ATMOS_EXCHANGE_MG_M2_D output interval == 3600.00 end output 4.9.2 TUFLOW FV outputs The most common output == blocks used to report the time variation of integrated quantities computed by TUFLOW FV are: Mass: output == mass flux: output == flux Variable names are not specified, with all available variables being included by default. Examples of such output blocks are: output == mass output interval == 3600.00 end output output == flux output interval == 3600.00 end output Both these output types produce .csv files with headers that append _MASS and _FLUX to the variable names presented in the Appendices. "],["AppSyntax.html", "Appendix A Syntax of command descriptions A.1 Commands A.2 Arguments A.3 Defaults", " Appendix A Syntax of command descriptions The manuals introduction should be reviewed for instructions regarding the use of interactive components deployed in this section. All WQM commands and descriptions are provided in Table B.1. This Appendix describes the syntax of that table. A.1 Commands WQM commands are coloured, for example frp adsorption parameters ==. These can be copied and pasted directly into a *.fvwq (or *.fvc where appropriate) control file, and arguments added. A.2 Arguments Descriptions of the arguments expected by WQM commands (i.e. information provided after the ==) are contrastingly coloured and always included in angle parentheses, as \\(\\langle\\)argument\\(\\rangle\\) . This argument content takes one of the following forms: A description. For example, for the material == WQM command, the argument is described as \\(\\langle\\)Up to 10 comma separated material numbers\\(\\rangle\\). An example of implementing this description would therefore be material == 1, 6, 3 Single keyword options. Options are separated by semicolons. Options need to be used exactly as written because they are keywords. For example, \\(\\langle\\)DO;inorganics;organics\\(\\rangle\\) describes the three available simulation options for the command simulation class ==. An example of implementing this description would therefore be simulation class == organics Single numeric values. Values are presented using their associated symbol, using the notation described in the manuals introductory sections. For example, \\(F_{sed}^{NO_3}\\) describes the single numeric value for the command nitrate flux ==. An example of implementing this description would therefore be nitrate flux == 5.7 Multiple numeric values. Values are presented using their associated symbol, using the notation described in the manuals introductory sections, and are separated by commas. The number of comma separated symbols indicates the number of expected numeric values. For example, \\(\\langle K_{sed-O_2}^{NH_4},\\theta_{sed}^{NH_4} \\rangle\\) describes the two numeric values expected for the command ammonium benthic ==. An example of implementing this description would therefore be ammonium benthic == 4.2, 1.08 Combined keyword and numeric value/s options. Arguments are separated by commas. Numeric arguments are represented by their associated symbol, using the notation described in the manuals introductory sections. Options need to be used exactly as written because they are keywords. Where different keyword options (for the same command) require different numbers or types of corresponding numerical arguments, these are listed as separate table entries for clarity. These different implementations of the same command are however easily navigated between by using the hyperlinked descriptive words in the right hand most table column. A.3 Defaults All WQM commands are optional (see Section 4.5), and where not specified by the user, the WQM will use library default arguments. These defaults are listed in a separate column of Table B.1. Where defaults are not appropriate, then N/A is listed in this column. Initial conditions must be specified via the *.fvc control file and do not have defaults. "],["AppCommands.html", "Appendix B Commands", " Appendix B Commands .book .book-body .page-wrapper .page-inner { max-width: 95%; } All WQM commands and descriptions follow. This page has deliberately been set to be wider than the main document so as to accommodate the detail contained within the table. Tips provided in the manuals introduction for interacting with the table should be reviewed, especially with regard to searching and navigation. Other tips for use specific to this table include: Commands are coloured and although they show as underlined on mouse hover, these are not hyperlinked Corresponding arguments (presented as their symbols) are coloured and listed in the required order within angled parentheses following each command ==. Each argument is a hyperlink to its description in the relevant Appendix. This description then includes hyperlinks to the relevant science and command syntax (Section 4). This allows easy navigation between command, parameter and scientific information The final text of each description is Simulation construction section  and is a link to the relevant part of Section 4 where the command syntax is presented in context. More parameter details and descriptions are subsequently available via further hyperlinks included in the construction section Commands that have multiple possible combinations of more than one argument are presented as separate table entries.

D.2 Sediment oxygen flux Oxygen is exchanged between the water column and sediments via specification of a sediment flux representing the net effect of biological activity. In the case of oxygen, this flux is most commonly into the sediments, i.e. a negative sediment flux. Although it is rare that sediments act as sources of oxygen, TUFLOW WQM can be parameterised to allow for this if required. The user specified sediment oxygen flux (which can be spatially varying) is modified by overlying ambient dissolved oxygen concentration (together with a user specified half saturation oxygen concentration) and water temperature. These modifications are simulated via Michaelis-Menten and Arrhenius models, respectively, as per Equation (D.4). \\[\\begin{equation} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagDOSedFlx}{F_{sed\\langle computed\\rangle}^{O_2}} = F_{sed}^{O_2} \\times \\underbrace{\\frac{\\left[DO\\right]}{K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2} + \\left[DO\\right]}}_{\\text{Influence of oxygen}} \\times \\underbrace{ \\vphantom{ \\frac{\\left[DO\\right]}{K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2} + \\left[DO\\right]} } \\left[\\theta_{sed}^{O_2}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)}}_{\\text{Influence of temperature}} \\tag{D.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{sed}^{O_2}\\) is the user specified oxygen sediment flux at 20\\(^o\\)C without the influence of dissolved oxygen, \\(\\left[DO\\right]\\) is the overlying dissolved oxygen concentration computed by the WQM, \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) and \\(\\theta_{sed}^{O_2}\\) are the half saturation oxygen concentration and temperature coefficient for dissolved oxygen sediment flux respectively, and \\(T\\) is ambient water temperature. The form of the above relationship between dissolved oxygen concentration and the computed oxygen sediment flux, for a range of \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) values is provided in Figure D.1. Water temperature is held constant at 20\\(^o\\)C and \\(\\theta_{sed}^{O_2}=1\\) (i.e. the Arrhenius temperature function is switched off). The user specified benthic oxygen sediment flux is -4,800 mg/m\\(^2\\)/day. Use the play button or drag the slider to see how different half saturation oxygen concentrations change the oxygen sediment flux (ordinate), as a function of ambient dissolved oxygen concentration (abscissa). Figure D.1: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) on the computed oxygen sediment flux The figure demonstrates that in this example, the smaller the value of \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\), the faster the magnitude of the computed oxygen sediment flux increases with ambient dissolved oxygen concentration. This is consistent with one interpretation of \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\), that it is the ambient dissolved oxygen concentration at which the computed oxygen sediment flux is half that of the user specified \\(F_{sed}^{O_2}\\), when temperature effects are turned off. In light of the above, the demonstration model has been used to illustrate the influence that the half saturation concentration has on the rate of drawdown of water column dissolved oxygen. The model was repeatedly executed using a different \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) for each simulation, but at the same water temperature of (approximately) 20\\(^o\\)C, and with temperature effects turned off. The predicted temporal evolution of water column dissolved oxygen concentration is provided in Figure D.2. Use the play button or drag the slider to see how different half saturation oxygen concentrations change the rate of dissolved oxygen (ordinate) drawdown with time (abscissa). Figure D.2: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) on the rate of consumption of dissolved oxygen in water immediately above the sediments Consistent with the behaviour demonstrated in Figure D.1, Figure D.2 has a less rapid drawdown of ambient dissolved oxygen concentrations with increasing \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\). The rate of dissolved oxygen drawdown is also related to ambient water temperature, via the Arrhenius model in Equation (D.4). To illustrate this, the demonstration model was executed at a range of ambient temperatures, a constant half saturation oxygen concentration for oxygen sediment flux of 4 mg/L and a temperature factor \\(\\theta_{sed}^{O_2}\\) of 1.05. The results are provided in Figure D.3. Use the play button or drag the slider to see how different ambient temperatures change the rate of dissolved oxygen (ordinate) drawdown under these conditions, with time (abscissa). Figure D.3: Move the slider to see the effect of changing the ambient water temperature on dissolved oxygen concentrations The figure confirms the expected result that the rate of dissolved oxygen drawdown increases with increasing ambient water temperature. This increased rate reflects the expected increase in benthic biological activity with temperature.

This means that silicate drawdown also occurs at a constant rate in the demonstration model, so the figure analogous to Figure D.2 is not presented here. A more realistic environmental setting has sediment silicate fluxes occurring against a background of oxygen concentration drawdown. The demonstration model has been used to illustrate this via execution of a suite of simulations that experience dissolved oxygen drawdown (in the dissolved oxygen constituent model, with \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) = 4 mg/L) and each simulation using a different value of \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{Si}\\).

As per silicate sediment flux (see Section E.1), the above equations lead to linearly varying ambient ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the demonstration model when dissolved oxygen concentration, half saturation oxygen concentrations and ambient temperature are set to be constant. A more realistic environmental setting has sediment ammonium and nitrate fluxes occurring against a background of oxygen concentration drawdown. The demonstration model has been used to illustrate this via execution of a suite of simulations that experience dissolved oxygen drawdown (in the dissolved oxygen constituent model, with \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) = 4 mg/L) and each simulation using a the same value for both \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{NH_4}\\) and \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{NO_3}\\). The ammonium and nitrate sediment flux rates were both specified as 140 mg/m\\(^2\\)/d, and temperature effects were turned off.

Figure F.1: Move the slider to see the effect of changing the \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{NH_4}\\) (and \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{NO_3}\\) - they are set to be equal to each other in this example) values on ambient ammonium and nitrate concentrations. Ambient dissolved oxygen is drawn down in time Figure F.1 illustrates the different oxygen responses of ammonium and nitrate sediment fluxes, as reflected in the different formulations within Equation (F.1). Importantly, the figure demonstrates that as ambient oxygen concentrations reach zero near 60 hours (see Figure D.2 with the slider bar set to \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) = 4 mg/L), nitrate sediment flux ceases and the resultant ambient concentrations plateau. The converse is true to ammonium. One implication of this behaviour is that in environmental systems being simulated using the WQM, the rate of delivery of ammonium mass to the water column will generally increase under low dissolved oxygen conditions (e.g. waters isolated underneath a strong lacustrine a thermocline), whilst the corresponding nitrate mass fluxes will reduce under the same conditions. This is the expected and observed behaviour of environmental systems. The rate of ammonium and nitrate flux is also related to ambient water temperature, via the Arrhenius model in Equation (F.1). To demonstrate this, the same model above (with time varying dissolved oxygen concentration) was executed at a range of ambient temperatures, but constant half saturation concentrations for oxygen for both ammonium and nitrate set to 4 mg/L. All temperature coefficients were set to 1.05. The results are provided in Figure F.2. Use the play button or drag the slider to see how different ambient temperatures change the ambient ammonium and nitrate concentrations (ordinate) in time (abscissa). Figure F.2: Move the slider to see the effect of changing the ambient water temperature on ammonium and nitrate concentrations, with ambient dissolved oxygen drawdown The figure shows that as ambient water temperature increases, the rate of increases of both ammonium and nitrate concentrations follow suit. Again, nitrate concentrations plateau once background dissolved oxygen concentrations reach zero, however ammonium concentrations continue to rise throughout the simulation. This is expected behaviour. F.2 Nitrification Nitrification is the pelagic biological oxidation of ammonium to nitrate. The equations representing this process (including intermediates) are as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} \\left.\\begin{aligned} 2NH_4^{+} + 3O_2 \\rightarrow &amp; 2NO_2^{-} + 4H^+ + 2H_2O \\\\ \\\\ 2NO_2^{-} + O_2 \\rightarrow &amp; 2NO_3^- \\end{aligned}\\right\\} \\tag{F.2} \\end{equation}\\] Dissolved oxygen is consumed by nitrification of ammonium, in a molar ratio of 1:2 N:O\\(_2\\) (i.e. 2 moles of ammonium consume 4 moles of diatomic oxygen). Nitrite is an intermediate product of nitrification, and simulation of this quantity is possible within the WQM although not currently activated. Contact support@tuflow.com if this capability is required. The pelagic nitrification rate is computed within the WQM via Equation (F.3). \\[\\begin{equation} R_{nitrif\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NH_4} = R_{nitrif}^{NH_4} \\times \\underbrace{\\frac{\\left[ DO \\right]}{K_{nitrif-O_2}^{NH_4} + \\left[DO\\right]}}_{\\text{Influence of oxygen}} \\times \\underbrace{ \\vphantom{\\frac{\\left[ DO \\right]}{K_{nitrif-O_2}^{NH_4} + \\left[DO\\right]}} \\left[\\theta_{nitrif}^{NH_4}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)}}_{\\text{Influence of temperature}} \\tag{F.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\(R_{nitrif}^{NH_4}\\) is the user specified ammonium nitrifcation rate at at 20\\(^o\\)C without the influence of dissolved oxygen, \\(\\left[DO\\right]\\) is the ambient dissolved oxygen concentration, \\(K_{nitrif-O_2}^{NH_4}\\) and \\(\\theta_{nitrif}^{NH_4}\\) are the half saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen and temperature coefficient for nitrification of ammonium respectively (both are user specified), and \\(T\\) is ambient water temperature. The nitrification rate from Equation (F.3) is multiplied by ambient ammonium concentration to compute the flux of ammonium to nitrate at each model timestep in each model cell via Equation (F.4). \\[\\begin{equation} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagNitrif}{F_{nitrif\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NH_4}} = R_{nitrif\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NH_4} \\times \\left[ NH_4 \\right] \\tag{F.4} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (F.3) reveals a linear relationship between \\(R_{nitrif\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NH_4}\\) and both (constant) dissolved oxygen concentration and half saturation oxygen concentration. In dissolved oxygen conditions away from oxygen sinks other than nitrification itself (such as sediments), this leaves ambient temperature as the key external determinant of the computed nitrification rates. A suite of demonstration model simulations were executed to illustrate this, with each simulation having its own temperature, and a constant nitrification rate \\(R_{nitrif}^{NH_4}\\) of 0.1/day. Ammonium and nitrate initial conditions were always set to 4 and 0 mg/L respectively, \\(K_{nitrif-O_2}^{NH_4}\\) to 4 mg/L and \\(\\theta_{nitrif}^{NH_4}\\) was set to 1.05. In order to illustrate only the workings of nitrification, all sediment fluxes were set to zero. The predicted temporal evolution of water column ammonium and nitrate concentrations in these simulations are provided in Figure F.3. Corresponding dissolved oxygen concentrations are also included to demonstrate the impact of nitrification on water column oxygen. Use the play button or drag the slider to see how different ambient temperatures change the ambient ammonium, nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations (ordinate) in time (abscissa). Figure F.3: Move the slider to see the effect of changing ambient water temperature on the concentrations of ammonia, nitrate and oxygen The figure demonstrates the expected behaviour, where ammonium is consumed and nitrate produced. The drawdown in oxygen presented in the figure is due only to nitrification. The figure also reveals the mass conserving behaviour of the WQM: the decrease in ammonium (N) concentration is the same as the corresponding increase in nitrate (N) concentration for each of the different temperature simulations. This confirms the 1:1 ratio of nitrogen conversion from ammonium to nitrate in moles (Equation (F.2)), and hence concentration in an otherwise closed system. The drawdown in oxygen also demonstrates the WQM mass balance. In the 12\\(^o\\)C case for example: The change in dissolved oxygen concentration is 4.37 mg/L Converting this to moles of O\\(_2\\) gives 0.1366 moles O\\(_2\\) (= 4.37/32) The change in ammonium (or nitrate) concentration is 0.955 mg/L Converting this to moles of N gives 0.0682 moles of N (= 0.955/14) The number of moles of dissolved oxygen consumed (0.137) is twice that the number of moles of N transformed from ammonium to nitrate (0.0682), to two decimal places. This is consistent with Equation (F.2). A full WQM mass balance is presented in Appendix R. F.3 Denitrification Denitrification is the pelagic biological reduction of nitrate to free nitrogen gas, \\(N_2\\). This typically occurs as a result of microbial oxygen stripping from nitrate in low dissolved oxygen environments. It occurs through a series of intermediate stages, but is typically represented as a single-step process with a governing denitrification rate. This rate is computed within the WQM via either Equation (F.5) or (F.6). These are identical other than their treatment of the influence of dissolved oxygen on denitrification, which is either Michaelis-Menten or exponential, respectively. Unlike nitrification, denitrification includes the influence of nitrate concentration in both rate calculations, again in a Michaelis-Menten form. \\[\\begin{equation} R_{denit\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NO_3} = R_{denit}^{NO_3} \\hphantom{\\text{abc}} \\times \\hphantom{\\text{abc}} \\frac{K_{denit-O_2-MM}^{NO_3}}{K_{denit-O_2-MM}^{NO_3} + \\left[DO\\right]} \\times \\left[\\theta_{denit}^{NO_3}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)} \\times \\frac{\\left[NO_3\\right]}{K_{denit-NO_3}^{NO_3} + \\left[NO_3\\right]} \\tag{F.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} R_{denit\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NO_3} = R_{denit}^{NO_3} \\hphantom{\\text{abc}} \\times \\hphantom{\\text{abc}} \\underbrace{\\vphantom{\\frac{\\left[NO_3\\right]}{K_{denit-NO_3}^{NO_3} + \\left[NO_3\\right]}}{\\rm e}^{\\left[\\frac{-\\left[DO\\right]}{K_{denit-O_2-exp}^{NO_3}}\\right]}}_{\\text{Influence of oxygen}} \\times \\hphantom{\\text{abcd}} \\underbrace{\\vphantom{\\frac{\\left[NO_3\\right]}{K_{denit-NO_3}^{NO_3} + \\left[NO_3\\right]}}\\left[\\theta_{denit}^{NO_3}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)}}_{\\text{Influence of temperature}} \\times \\underbrace{\\frac{\\left[NO_3\\right]}{K_{denit-NO_3}^{NO_3} + \\left[NO_3\\right]}}_{\\text{Influence of nitrate}} \\tag{F.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\(R_{denit}^{NO_3}\\) is the user specified nitrate denitrification rate at 20\\(^o\\)C and without the influence of dissolved oxygen, and \\(\\left[DO\\right]\\) and \\(\\left[NO_3\\right]\\) are the ambient dissolved oxygen and nitrate concentrations respectively. If the Michaelis-Menten oxygen model is used then \\(K_{denit-O2-MM}^{NO_3}\\) is the half saturation concentration of oxygen for denitrification. If the exponential model is used then \\(K_{denit-O2-exp}^{NO_3}\\) is the dissolved oxygen concentration that normalises (i.e. non-dimensionalises) the ambient oxygen concentration used in Equation (F.6). Equation (F.5) is the default. Finally, \\(\\theta_{denit}^{NO_3}\\) is the temperature coefficient for denitrification of nitrate, \\(T\\) is ambient water temperature, and \\(K_{denit-NO_3}^{NO_3}\\) is the Michaelis-Menten half saturation nitrate concentration that influences denitrification in both Equations (F.5) and (F.6). \\(K_{denit-NO_3}^{NO_3}\\) is not user definable, but hardwired to a value of 0.07 mg/L of nitrate (5.0 mmol/m\\(^3\\)). The computed denitrification rate from Equation (F.5) or (F.6) is then multiplied by ambient nitrate concentration to compute the flux of nitrate to free nitrogen gas at each model timestep in each model cell via Equation (F.7). \\[\\begin{equation} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagDenitrif}{F_{denit\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NO_3}} = R_{denit\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NO_3} \\times \\left[ NO_3 \\right] \\tag{F.7} \\end{equation}\\] Unlike nitrification, denitrification does not produce or consume dissolved oxygen. It does, however, consume nitrate and therefore presents a feedback loop in Equations (F.5) through (F.7). The demonstration model was executed over two suites of identical simulations that varied temperature from one simulation to the next, with the first suite using Equation (F.5) and the second suite using Equation (F.6). Only denitrification was turned on, and constant values for \\(R_{denit}^{NO_3}\\) (1.5/day - a deliberately very large value was chosen to demonstrate trends), \\(K_{denit-O_2}^{NO_3}\\) (4 mg/L) and \\(K_{denit-NO_3}^{NO_3}\\) (15.5 mg/L) were set. Temperature coefficients were set to 1.05. The predicted temporal evolution of water column nitrate concentrations in these simulation pairs are provided in Figure F.4. Figure F.4: Move the slider to see the effect of changing temperature on the concentrations of nitrate, where two different denitrification models are used The figure demonstrates the expected behaviour, where nitrate is consumed in a non-linear manner. The different models produce different drawdown rates, also as expected. In this example, these differences are substantial. The same two suites of demonstration models were also used to illustrate the influence of varying \\(K_{denit-O_2}^{NO_3}\\) (instead of temperature) on denitrification. All set ups from the models used above were retained, other than setting ambient water temperature to constant at 20 \\(^o\\)C, and allowing \\(K_{denit-O_2}^{NO_3}\\) to vary. The predicted temporal evolution of water column nitrate concentrations in these demonstration model simulation pairs are provided in Figure F.5. Figure F.5: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(K_{denit-O_2}^{NO_3}\\) on the concentrations of nitrate, where two different denitrification models are used Substantial differences in the prediction of nitrate concentrations is again observed, especially at lower half saturation concentrations. Although not recommended, the influence of oxygen in all the above processes can be removed by setting the command oxygen == off in the nitrogen model block. This switch applies to sediment flux, nitrification and denitrifcation equally. F.4 Wet deposition of inorganic nitrogen Wet deposition of inorganic nitrogen includes the pluvial delivery of both ammonium and nitrate to the water column. A global total inorganic nitrogen concentration in rainfall is specifiable, together with the proportion of that total that is nitrate. From this, the WQM computes ammonium and nitrate concentrations (Equations (F.8) and (F.9), respectively). \\[\\begin{equation} \\left[{NH_4}\\right]_{rain} = \\left[{TN}\\right]_{rain} \\times (1-f_{TN}^{NO_3}) \\tag{F.8} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\left[{NO_3}\\right]_{rain} = \\left[{TN}\\right]_{rain} \\times f_{TN}^{NO_3} \\tag{F.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\left[{TN}\\right]_{rain}\\) and \\(f_{TN}^{NO_3}\\) are the concentration of total nitrogen in rain and the fraction of that total that is nitrate, respectively. The WQM separately multiplies \\(\\left[{NH_4}\\right]_{rain}\\) and \\(\\left[{NO_3}\\right]_{rain}\\) by each timesteps rainfall depth and corresponding model surface area(s) to compute the wet mass flux of ammonium and nitrate (Equations (F.10) and (F.11), respectively). These masses are added to the uppermost model layer cells and corresponding changes to ambient concentrations computed. \\[\\begin{equation} F_{atm-wet}^{NH_4} = \\left[{NH_4}\\right]_{rain} \\times \\text{Timestep rainfall depth} \\times \\text{Model area(s)} \\tag{F.10} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} F_{atm-wet}^{NO_3} = \\left[{NO_3}\\right]_{rain} \\times \\text{Timestep rainfall depth} \\times \\text{Model area(s)} \\tag{F.11} \\end{equation}\\] If rainfall depth is specified as being spatially variable (i.e. by application of multiple atmospheric boundary conditions within TUFLOW FV), then \\(F_{atm-wet}^{NH_4}\\) and \\(F_{atm-wet}^{NO_3}\\) will correspondingly vary spatially. F.5 Dry deposition of inorganic nitrogen Dry deposition of nitrogen includes the delivery of both ammonium and nitrate to the water column from atmospheric fallout. This fallout is typically thought of as being associated with dust, with the dry fallout dissolving on entry to the water column to become dissolved inorganic nitrogen. A single constant daily deposition rate of total nitrogen is specifiable, and the WQM splits this into separate ammonia and nitrate rates using the same fraction applied to the wet deposition total inorganic nitrogen concentration (Section F.4). \\[\\begin{equation} R^{NH_4}_{atm-dry} = R^{TN}_{atm-dry} \\times (1-f_{TN}^{NO_3}) \\tag{F.12} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} R^{NO_3}_{atm-dry} = R^{TN}_{atm-dry} \\times f_{TN}^{NO_3} \\tag{F.13} \\end{equation}\\] \\(R^{TN}_{atm-dry}\\) and \\(f_{TN}^{NO_3}\\) are the user specified rate of dry total inorganic nitrogen deposition, and the fraction that is nitrate, respectively.

This flux is most commonly out of the sediments, i.e. a positive specification of sediment flux. Although it is rare that sediments act as sinks of FRP, TUFLOW WQM can be parameterised to allow for this if required. The user specified rate of FRP flux (which can be spatially varying) is modified by overlying ambient dissolved oxygen concentration (together with a user specified half saturation oxygen concentration) and water temperature. These modifications are simulated via Michaelis-Menten and Arrhenius models, respectively, as per Equation (G.1). \\[\\begin{equation} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagFRPSedFlx}{F_{sed\\langle computed\\rangle}^{FRP}} = F_{sed}^{FRP} \\times \\underbrace{\\frac{K_{sed-O_2}^{FRP}}{K_{sed-O_2}^{FRP} + \\left[DO\\right]}}_{\\text{Influence of oxygen}} \\times \\underbrace{\\vphantom{\\frac{K_{sed-O_2}^{FRP}}{K_{sed-O_2}^{FRP} + \\left[DO\\right]}} \\left[\\theta_{sed}^{FRP}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)}}_{\\text{Influence of temperature}} \\tag{G.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{sed}^{FRP}\\) is the user specified FRP sediment flux at 20\\(^o\\)C without the influence of dissolved oxygen, \\(\\left[DO\\right]\\) is the overlying dissolved oxygen concentration, \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{FRP}\\) is the user specified half saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen for FRP sediment flux, \\(\\theta_{sed}^{FRP}\\) is the corresponding temperature coefficient, and \\(T\\) is ambient water temperature. As per silicate sediment fluxes (see Section E.1), the above equation leads to linearly varying ambient FRP concentrations in the demonstration model when dissolved oxygen concentration, half saturation oxygen concentration and temperature are set to be constant. A more realistic environmental setting has sediment FRP flux occurring against a background of oxygen concentration drawdown. The demonstration model has been used to illustrate this via execution of a suite of simulations that experience dissolved oxygen drawdown, with \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) = 4 mg/L and each simulation using a different \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{FRP}\\). The FRP sediment flux rate was specified as 400 mg/m\\(^2\\)/d and temperature effects were turned off. The predicted temporal evolution of water column FRP concentrations is provided in Figure G.1. Use the play button or drag the slider to see how different half saturation concentrations change ambient concentrations. Figure G.1: Move the slider to see the effect of changing the \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{FRP}\\) values on ambient FRP concentrations. Ambient dissolved oxygen is drawn down in time The rate of FRP flux is also related to ambient water temperature, via the Arrhenius model in Equations (G.1). To demonstrate this, the same model above (with time varying dissolved oxygen concentration) was executed at a range of ambient temperatures, but constant half saturation concentrations for oxygen set to 4 mg/L. All temperature coefficients were set to 1.05. The results are provided in Figure G.2. Use the play button or drag the slider to see how different ambient temperatures change ambient concentrations. Figure G.2: Move the slider to see the effect of changing the ambient water temperature on the rate of FRP fluxes to water immediately above the sediments, with ambient dissolved oxygen drawdown The figure shows that as ambient water temperature increases, the rate of increase of FRP concentrations follow suit. This is expected behaviour. G.2 Wet deposition of inorganic phosphorus Wet deposition of inorganic phosphorus includes the pluvial delivery of free reactive phosphorus to the water column. A global FRP concentration in rainfall is specifiable. The WQM multiplies this concentration by each timesteps rainfall depth and corresponding model surface area(s) to compute the wet mass flux of FRP over each timestep (Equation (G.2)). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{atm-wet}^{FRP} = \\left[{FRP}\\right]_{rain} \\times \\text{Timestep rainfall depth} \\times \\text{Model area} \\tag{G.2} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\left[{FRP}\\right]_{rain}\\) is the specified rainfall concentration of FRP. This mass is added to the uppermost model layer cells and corresponding changes to ambient FRP concentrations computed. If rainfall depth is specified as being spatially variable (i.e. by application of multiple atmospheric boundary conditions within TUFLOW FV), then \\(F_{atm-wet}^{FRP}\\) will correspondingly vary spatially. G.3 Dry deposition of inorganic phosphorus Dry deposition of inorganic phosphorus includes the delivery of adsorbed FRP to the water column from atmospheric dust fallout. A constant daily mass loading rate of adsorbed FRP is specifiable, and the WQM multiples this rate by model timestep and the global model surface area to compute the mass flux of adsorbed FRP (Equation (G.3)). This mass is added to the uppermost model layer cells and corresponding changes to ambient concentrations computed. Dry deposition is only included in calculations if adsorbed FRP is simulated. \\[\\begin{equation} F_{atm-dry}^{FRPads} = R^{FRPads}_{atm-dry} \\times \\text{Timestep} \\times \\text{Global model area} \\tag{G.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\(R^{FRPads}_{atm-dry}\\) is the user specified rate of adsorbed FRP atmospheric fallout. One (constant) mass flux is applied globally. This dry deposition is only applied if FRP adsorption is simulated, and if this is the case, then this introduction of dry deposited FRP is assigned to the adsorbed FRP computed variable. If adsorbed FRP is not included in a simulation, then dry deposition of FRP will be ignored. The total atmospheric depositional flux of inorganic phosphorus is as per Equation (G.4). \\[\\begin{equation} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagDIPAtmFlx}{F_{atm-dip\\langle computed \\rangle}^{P}} = F_{atm-wet}^{FRP} + F_{atm-dry}^{FRPads} \\tag{G.4} \\end{equation}\\] G.4 Adsorption and Desorption At each timestep and within each active computational cell, the WQM distributes the total FRP mass between dissolved FRP and adsorbed FRP if the phosphorus adsorption constituent model is used.

The above equations offer alternative approaches to simulating the distribution of total FRP between adsorbed and free states. Figures G.3 and G.4 (only Figure G.4 is interactive) provide indicative representations of the general form of these relationships, for assumed total FRP (0.1 mg/L) and SS (5mg/L) concentrations. Figure G.3: The change in distribution of dissolved and adsorbed FRP under the linear adsorption model. This figure has no slider bar Figure G.4: The change in distribution of dissolved and adsorbed FRP under the quadratic adsorption model The parameters used to prepare the above figures were deliberately chosen to illustrate the different behaviour that can result from these two models. This underscores the need to make careful decisions regarding the selection of an adsorption model, and to use WQM diagnostic outputs to assess model performance. G.5 Settling At each timestep and within each active computational cell, the WQM computes the mass of adsorbed FRP that has settled either through the water column or onto the bed, using the settling velocities for each eligible sediment fraction, as provided by TUFLOW FV. Settled adsorbed FRP that reaches the bed is considered to be a permanent sink of FRP and is not returned to the WQM. If new sediment is (re)suspended by the STM then it is included in adsorption and desorption calculations as per Section G.4, but without returning any previously settled FRP to the water column. "],["AppPhy.html", "Appendix H Processes: phyto general H.1 General H.2 Units", " Appendix H Processes: phyto general H.1 General Any number of phytoplankton groups may be simulated within the WQM, however the majority of environmental modelling applications rarely require (or have data to justify) including more than a relatively small number. Each phytoplankton group can have its properties set independently, where these properties typically relate to interaction with temperature, light, salinity and nutrients. The WQM offers two constituent models for the simulation of phytoplankton. These are referred to as basic and advanced, and are primarily differentiated on the basis of whether internal nutrients are simulated, as: Constituent model basic does not include simulation of internal phytoplanktonic nutrients Constituent model advanced does include simulation of internal phytoplanktonic nutrients This constituent model naming is intended to reflect a view that excluding simulation of internal nutrients is a simpler, more rudimentary, approach to phytoplankton modelling. Similarly, internal nutrient simulation generally requires specification of a larger suite of parameters than when the process is excluded, so is often considered to be a more complex and involved approach to phytoplankton simulation. A WQM simulation can include any combination of these two constituent models if multiple phytoplankton groups are simulated. For example, if three phytoplankton groups are to be simulated, two groups could be set to use the basic constituent model, and one to use the advanced constituent model. Where WQM calculations are completed differently between these two constituent models, their respective approaches are presented in a complementary but distinct manner following. H.2 Units Phytoplankton is accounted within the WQM in units of carbon, however carbon need not be explicitly simulated within the WQM as either inorganic (not yet available) or organic (labile and/or refractory) to support this approach. If this is the case, then uptake or loss of carbon by phytoplankton is still computed as it is the basis for accounting and reporting phytoplankton concentrations. The associated carbon sources and sinks that interact with phytoplankton carbon however, are assumed to be large and are not specifically accounted for as computed variables. A user specified (or default) conversion ratio between mg of carbon and mg of chlorophyll a, \\(X_{cc}^{phy}\\), is used to present carbon model outputs in units of \\(\\mu\\)/L chlorophyll a when necessary. "],["PhyRates-3.html", "Appendix I Processes: phyto biomass rates I.1 Primary productivity I.2 Respiration I.3 Exudation I.4 Settling", " Appendix I Processes: phyto biomass rates The rates that determine the temporal evolution of a phytoplankton groups biomass are primary productivity, respiration, exudation and settling. In general terms these processes can be thought of as follows: Primary productivity is the consumption of carbon and the generation of oxygen and carbohydrate due to photosynthesis. Photosynthetically active radiation catalyses this process so it occurs only durinig daylight hours. This process is also referred to as growth or gross primary productivity Respiration is the consumption of oxygen and stored carbohydrate and the production of carbon. This can be thought of as the reverse of primary productivity. Respiration dominates phytoplankton dynamics during nighttime hours, although can still operate during the daytime Exudation (also referred to as photo exudation) is the loss of phytoplankton biomass as a result of primary productivity Settling is the physical settling of phytoplankton, including motility The general form of the phytoplankton flux relationship for any given computational cell is therefore given by Equation (I.1). \\[\\begin{equation} F^{phy} = \\text{Primary productivity} - f(\\text{Respiration, Exudation}) - \\text{Settling} \\tag{I.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(f\\) represents functions described in Appendix L. The fundamental rates in Equation (I.1) are described following. I.1 Primary productivity The primary productivity rate is computed in a series of stages within the WQM, where the combination of these stages used for any given phytoplankton group depends on group configuration. These stages are described below. For clarity, supporting functions nested within primary productivity rate calculations (such as limitation functions) are initially presented in passing, but are cross referenced to detailed descriptions in subsequent Appendices The rate of primary productivity (often referred to as just productivity or growth rate) of a phytoplankton group is a /day rate. It is computed initially within the WQM as per Equation (I.2). \\[\\begin{equation} R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = R_{prod}^{phy} \\times L_T^{phy} \\times \\text{min}\\left(L_{lght}^{phy},L_{nit}^{phy},L_{phs}^{phy},L_{sil}^{phy}\\right) \\tag{I.2} \\end{equation}\\] For each phytoplankton group, \\(R_{prod}^{phy}\\) is the user specified (or default) phytoplankton productivity (growth) rate at 20\\(^o\\)C with no light, temperature, salinity, silicate or nutrient limitation, and \\(L_T^{phy}\\), \\(L_{lght}^{phy}\\), \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\), \\(L_{phs}^{phy}\\), \\(L_{sil}^{phy}\\) are the computed limitation functions for water temperature, light, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate, respectively. These functions, when appropriate, act to modify \\(R_{prod}^{phy}\\), noting that only \\(L_T^{phy}\\) always does so. The other limitation functions in Equation (I.2) act collectively, with only the most limiting (i.e. the smallest function value) of \\(L_{lght}^{phy}\\), \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\), \\(L_{phs}^{phy}\\) and \\(L_{sil}^{phy}\\) being selected to also multiplicatively modify \\(R_{prod}^{phy}\\) with \\(L_T^{phy}\\). If nitrogen fixing is implemented, then the \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) computed in Equation (I.2) is further modified as per Equation (I.3). \\[\\begin{equation} R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times \\left(L_{nit}^{phy} \\times \\left(1.0 - f_{nfix}^{phy}\\right)\\right) \\tag{I.3} \\end{equation}\\] \\(f_{nfix}^{phy}\\) is the user (or default) rate modifier that accounts for the metabolic cost of nitrogen fixing on primary productivity. This modifier can be thought of as a penalty function, with values of zero and one corresponding to no and maximum penalties, respectively. Because this rate modifier is applied to \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) if a phytoplankton group is a nitrogen fixer, specification of a \\(f_{nfix}^{phy}\\) of one will set \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) to zero: primary productivity will never occur. Conversely, if \\(f_{nfix}^{phy}\\) is set to 0, then no metabolic penalty is applied as result of implementing nitrogen fixing. Typically, the expectation would be that the true penalty lies not at either zero or one, but at \\(0 \\lt f_{nfix}^{phy} \\lt 1\\). Salinity limitation is not mandatory, and can be switched on and off by the user. If salinity limitation is implemented, then the \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) computed above is further modified as per Equation (I.4). \\[\\begin{equation} R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times L_{sal}^{phy} \\tag{I.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\(L_{sal}^{phy}\\) is the limitation due to salinity. Once the rate of primary productivity has been computed by applying Equation (I.2), and potentially Equations (I.3) and (I.4), the corresponding flux of carbon (i.e. phytoplankton growth) to a phytoplankton group is computed as per Equation (I.5). \\[\\begin{equation} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagPhyPriProd}{F_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}} = R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\tag{I.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is the ambient phytoplankton group concentration. These fluxes are summed over all simulated phytoplankton groups to compute the community primary productivity, \\(F_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{comm}\\). The WQM uses a minimum concentration \\(\\left[PHY\\right]_{min}\\) to maintain phytoplankton concentrations above zero. This is because if concentrations decrease to zero, then by Equation (I.5), phytoplankton fluxes (and therefore concentrations) will remain at zero regardless of computed primary productivity rates. I.2 Respiration The respiration rate is computed in a series of stages within the WQM, where the combination of these stages used for any given phytoplankton group depends on group configuration. These stages are described below. For clarity, supporting functions nested within respiration rate calculations (such as limitation functions) are initially presented in passing, but are cross referenced to detailed descriptions in subsequent sections. The rate of respiration of a phytoplankton group is a /day rate. It is computed initially within the WQM as per Equation (I.6). \\[\\begin{equation} R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = R_{resp}^{phy} \\times \\underbrace{\\left[\\theta_{resp}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)}}_{\\text{Influence of temperature}} \\tag{I.6} \\end{equation}\\] \\(R_{resp}^{phy}\\) is the user specified phytoplankton respiration rate at 20\\(^o\\)C, \\(\\theta_{resp}^{phy}\\) is the temperature coefficient for respiration, and \\(T\\) is ambient water temperature. Figure I.1 presents the influence of \\(\\theta_{resp}^{phy}\\) on \\(R_{resp}^{phy}\\), as a function of temperature. Figure I.1: Move the slider to see the effect of changing temperature coefficient on the computed phytoplankton respiration rate If salinity limitation is implemented, and is one of the models XX, YY, ZZ, then the \\(R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) computed above is further modified as per Equation (I.7). , \\[\\begin{equation} R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times L_{sal}^{phy} \\tag{I.7} \\end{equation}\\] \\(L^{phy}_{sal}\\) is the limitation function on respiration due to salinity. Salinity limitation is applied to only one of primary production (Section I.1) or respiration, depending on the salinity limitation model selected, and not both. If a groups ambient phytoplankton concentration is less than the user defined (or default) minimum concentration \\(\\left[PHY\\right]_{min}\\), then the respiration rate is set to zero. Once the respiration rate has been computed, the corresponding flux of carbon (i.e. phytoplankton respiration) from a phytoplankton group is as per Equation (I.8). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\tag{I.8} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is the ambient phytoplankton group concentration.

These fluxes are summed over all simulated phytoplankton groups to compute the community net primary productivity, \\(F_{netprod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{comm}\\). \\(F_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) can be computed from the WQMs reported diagnostic variables for a single phytoplankton group via Equation (I.9). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = \\frac{\\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagPhyPriProd}{F_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}} - \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagPhyNetProd}{F_{netprod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}}}{f_{true-resp}^{phy}} \\tag{I.9} \\end{equation}\\] I.3 Exudation The exudation rate of a phytoplankton group is a /day rate. It is computed within the WQM as per Equation (I.10). \\[\\begin{equation} R_{exud\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times f_{exud}^{phy} \\tag{I.10} \\end{equation}\\] \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) is the previously computed phytoplankton primary production rate (Equations (I.2), and potentially (I.3) and (I.4)), and \\(f_{exud}^{phy}\\) is the user defined (or default) fraction of primary production lost to exudation. This exudation loss is a linear function. If a groups ambient phytoplankton concentration is less than the user defined (or default) minimum concentration \\(\\left[PHY\\right]_{min}\\), then the exudation rate is set to zero. I.4 Settling The settling rate \\(V_{settle}^{phy}\\) (also referred to as motility) of a phytoplankton group is computed within the WQM for each phytoplankton group, prior to the corresponding primary production, respiration and exudation rate calculations. There are several phytoplankton settling models available within the WQM. These are described following, and once the settling rate has been computed, the flux (loss) of phytoplankton to the sediments (i.e. from the bottom cell of each computational water column only) is computed for each phytoplankton group via Equation (I.11). \\[\\begin{equation} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagPhySedmtn}{F_{sedmtn\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}} = V_{settle}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\tag{I.11} \\end{equation}\\] These fluxes are summed over all simulated phytoplankton groups to compute the community sedimentation rate, \\(F_{sedmtn\\langle computed\\rangle}^{comm}\\). I.4.1 None In this model, phytoplankton settling is set to zero, and phytoplankton are simply advected by the hydrodynamic flow field. I.4.2 Constant In this model, phytoplankton settling is set to a constant value, and phytoplankton are settled at this velocity. A negative specification of this quantity corresponds to a downwards settling velocity. I.4.3 Constant with density correction In this model, phytoplankton settling is set to a constant value, and phytoplankton are settled at this velocity, but corrected for ambient water density effects, as per Equation (I.12). \\[\\begin{equation} V_{sett\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = V_{settle}^{phy} \\times \\frac{\\mu_{20}\\times\\rho_w}{\\mu\\times\\rho_{w20}} \\tag{I.12} \\end{equation}\\] \\(V_{settle}^{phy}\\) is the specified settling rate (velocity) at 20\\(^o\\)C, \\(\\mu\\) and \\(\\rho_w\\) are the ambient water dynamic viscosity (in Ns/m\\(^2\\)) and density (in kg/m\\(^3\\)), respectively, and \\(\\mu_{20}\\) and \\(\\rho_{w20}\\) are the dynamic viscosity and density of freshwater at 20\\(^o\\)C, respectively. A negative specification of \\(V_{settle}^{phy}\\) corresponds to a downwards settling velocity. I.4.4 Stokes In this model, phytoplankton settling is computed using the Stokes equation and cell diameter and density, as per Equation (I.13). \\[\\begin{equation} V_{sett\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} = -g \\times d_{phy}^2 \\times \\frac{\\left(\\rho_{phy}-\\rho_w\\right)}{18\\mu} \\tag{I.13} \\end{equation}\\] \\(g\\) is acceleration due to gravity, \\(d_{phy}\\) and \\(\\rho_{phy}\\) are phytoplankton cell diameter and density, respectively, and \\(\\rho_w\\) and \\(\\mu\\) are the ambient water density and dynamic viscosity, respectively. This model is only available if phytoplankton cell density is dynamically simulated. Cell density is therefore required to be simulated as a computed variable in both cases, with supporting initial and boundary condition specifications. Cell diameter is fixed at 1 \\(\\times\\) 10 \\(^{-5}\\) m. Even though a half saturation light intensity \\(I_K\\) is not required to compute the settling velocity directly, it is required to compute the cell density term in Equation (I.13). Cell density is computed as described in Appendix M.2. \\(I_K\\) can therefore be specified in the command to set stokes settling (referred to as \\(I_{K-sto}\\)), if it is not already specified in a phytoplankton constituent model light limitation function. I.4.5 Motile The motility settling model can only be used if internal nutrients are simulated, via deployment of the advanced phytoplankton constituent model. In this model, phytoplankton are permitted to be motile, with the motility velocity being either a user specified value (and either upwards or downwards), or zero. This motility behaviour is governed by phytoplankton internal nutrient status and ambient environmental conditions, as follows: If \\(Q \\lt 0.675 \\times X_{N-C-max}^{phy}\\) then phytoplankton is starved of nutrients and swims downwards at a rate \\(V_{mot}^{phy}\\) If \\(Q \\gt 0.750 \\times X_{N-C-max}^{phy}\\) then phytoplankton is replete of nutrients and: If local photosynthetically available radiation is greater than \\(I_{K-mot}\\) then phytoplankton swim up at \\(V_{mot}^{phy}\\) If local photosynthetically available radiation is less than \\(I_{K-mot}\\) then phytoplankton are not motile If \\(0.675 \\times X_{N-C-max}^{phy} \\lt Q \\lt 0.750 \\times X_{N-C-max}^{phy}\\) then phytoplankton are not motile \\(V_{mot}^{phy}\\) is the user specified motility velocity where a negative value is treated as a downwards motility, \\(Q\\) is the instantaneous ratio of phytoplankton internal nitrogen to carbon computed by the WQM (N/C, not \\(R_{IN-IP}^{phy}\\)), \\(X_{N-C-max}^{phy}\\) is the maximum internal nitrogen to carbon concentration ratio either user specified (or default) in the advanced constituent model and \\(I_{K-mot}\\) is the half saturation constant for light limitation of growth. A value of \\(I_{K-mot}\\) specified in the settling model will be ignored if it has been specified in the light limitation model. Overriding all of the above is the condition that if local photosynthetically available radiation is greater than 95% of the water surface value, motility is set to zero as phytoplankton are considered to already be at the surface of the model domain. "],["PhyLimits-3.html", "Appendix J Processes: phyto limitation J.1 General J.2 Temperature J.3 Nitrogen J.4 Phosphorus J.5 Silicate J.6 Light J.7 Salinity", " Appendix J Processes: phyto limitation J.1 General Several functions are available within the WQM that allow for modification of computed phytoplankton rates in response to environmental conditions. These functions were mentioned in passing in previous Appendices and are called limitation functions because they describe how temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicate, light and salinity potentially limit phytoplankton rates. Their computed values are always dimensionless and between zero and one, and are applied multiplicatively to modify initially computed rates. Limitation functions of zero completely shut off initially computed rates, and conversely, limitation functions of one do not affect these rates whatsoever. Limitation functions that are valued between zero and one linearly affect computed rates as per Equation (I.2). The key principle of limitation functions is that they provide a quantitative comparison of phytoplanktonic rate requirements with ambient conditions, and then modify phytoplankton behaviour accordingly. For example, an initially computed \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) may make a productivity demand on ambient nitrogen that exceeds instantaneous nitrogen availability. In this case, primary production will need to be reduced to reflect this nitrogen scarcity. This is affected via the multiplicative application to the initial primary productivity rate of a (computed) nitrogen limitation \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\) that is less than one. A similar principle applies to temperature, phosphorus, silicate, light and salinity limitation functions: they modify computed phytoplanktonic rates based on a relative assessment of these rates to instantaneous ambient environmental conditions. There are multiple limitation functions available within the WQM for each of temperature, nitrogen, phosphorus, silicate, light and salinity. These are described below. J.2 Temperature Temperature limitation is often considered a key influencer of phytoplankton dynamics. The WQM offers the following temperature limitation functions. J.2.1 None This model includes no temperature limitation to the computed primary productivity rate. The temperature limitation is set to 1.0 for all temperatures. J.2.2 Standard This is a generic yet customisable temperature limitation function. It comprises three piecewise continuous sub functions: \\[\\begin{equation} L_{T}^{phy} = \\begin{cases} \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)} &amp; \\text{$T \\le T_{std}^{phy}$} \\\\ \\\\ f(T_{opt}^{phy},T_{std}^{phy},T_{max}^{phy}) &amp; \\text{$T_{std}^{phy} \\lt T \\le T_{max}^{phy}$} \\\\ \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{$T_{max}^{phy} \\lt T$} \\end{cases} \\tag{J.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\) is the temperature coefficient for primary productivity, \\(f\\) is a sub function of \\(T_{opt}^{phy}\\), \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) and \\(T_{max}^{phy}\\), which are the optimal, standard and maximum water temperatures respectively, and \\(T\\) is ambient water temperature. The function \\(f\\) comprises a two stage algorithm: Stage 1. Preprocess \\(T_{opt}^{phy}\\), \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) and \\(T_{max}^{phy}\\) in a once-off iterative calculation to generate a secondary suite of parameters that are then used in Stage 2 computations Stage 2. Use ambient environmental conditions, \\(\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\), \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) and the parameters generated in Stage 1 to compute the temperature limitation function at every water quality timestep and computational cell throughout a simulation Stage 1 The intent of Stage 1 is to use \\(T_{opt}^{phy}\\), \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) and \\(T_{max}^{phy}\\) to iteratively compute three parameters \\(aTn\\), \\(bTn\\) and \\(kTn\\) that describe a curve fitting of \\(L_{T}^{phy}\\) between \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) and \\(T_{max}^{phy}\\) (i.e. function \\(f\\) in Equation (J.1)). The conditions for this curve fitting ensure that \\(L_{T}^{phy}\\) is piecewise continuous: \\[\\begin{equation} L_{T}^{phy} = \\begin{cases} \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)} &amp; \\text{$T = T_{std}^{phy}$} \\\\ \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{$T = T_{max}^{phy}$} \\end{cases} \\tag{J.2} \\end{equation}\\] To do so, the WQM uses Equation (J.3) to compute the intermediate quantity \\(G\\) by iterating on \\(kTn\\), with the \\(kTn\\) seed set to 6.0. \\[\\begin{equation} \\left.\\begin{aligned} G = &amp;\\left(kTn \\times \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(kTn \\times T_{opt}^{phy}\\right)} \\times \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T_{max}^{phy} - 20.0 \\right)}\\right) - \\ldots \\\\ \\\\ &amp;\\left(\\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T_{opt}^{phy} - 20.0 \\right)} \\times \\left( \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(kTn \\times T_{max}^{phy}\\right)} - \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(kTn \\times T_{std}^{phy}\\right)} \\right)\\right) \\end{aligned}\\right\\} \\tag{J.3} \\end{equation}\\] The iteration target is \\(|G| \\le 0.5\\). If this target is not met on a given iteration, a new value of \\(kTn\\) is computed as per Equation (J.4). \\[\\begin{equation} kTn = kTn - \\frac{G}{\\nabla G} \\tag{J.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\nabla G\\) is computed as per Equation (J.5). \\[\\begin{equation} \\left.\\begin{aligned} \\nabla G =&amp; \\left(\\left(\\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(kTn \\times T_{opt}^{phy}\\right)} \\times \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T_{max}^{phy} - 20.0 \\right)}\\right) \\times \\left(1.0 + kTn \\times T_{opt}^{phy} \\times ln\\left(\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right)\\right)\\right) - \\ldots \\\\ \\\\ &amp;\\left(\\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T_{opt}^{phy} - 20.0 \\right)} \\times ln\\left(\\theta_{T}^{hy}\\right) \\times \\left(T_{max}^{phy} \\times \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(kTn \\times T_{max}^{phy}\\right)} - T_{std}^{phy} \\times \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(kTn \\times T_{std}^{phy}\\right)}\\right)\\right) \\end{aligned}\\right\\} \\tag{J.5} \\end{equation}\\] Once the iteration target is met (i.e. \\(|G| \\le 0.5\\)), the final value of \\(kTn\\) is used to compute \\(aTn\\) and \\(bTn\\) as per Equation (J.6). \\[\\begin{equation} \\left.\\begin{aligned} aTn &amp;= \\frac{-ln\\left(\\frac{\\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T_{opt}^{phy}-20\\right)}}{kTn \\times \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(kTn \\times T_{opt}^{phy}\\right)}}\\right)}{kTn \\times ln\\left(\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right)} \\\\ \\\\ bTn &amp;= \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{kTn \\times \\left(T_{std}^{phy}-aTn\\right)} \\end{aligned}\\right\\} \\tag{J.6} \\end{equation}\\] All of \\(aTn\\), \\(bTn\\) and \\(kTn\\) are fixed at the end of Stage 1 for repeated use in Stage 2. and used in Stage 2 at every timestep and model cell to compute \\(L_{T}^{phy}\\) in the water temperature range between \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) and \\(T_{max}^{phy}\\). Stage 2 The intent of Stage 2 is to use \\(aTn\\), \\(bTn\\) and \\(kTn\\) to describe a curve for \\(L_{T}^{phy}\\) between \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) and \\(T_{max}^{phy}\\). This curve is computed as per Equation (J.7). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{T}^{phy} = \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)} - \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{kTn \\times \\left(T-aTn\\right)} + bTn \\tag{J.7} \\end{equation}\\] The complete piecewise continuous function for the generic temperature limitation function \\(L_T^{phy}\\) is provided in Equation (J.8). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{T}^{phy} = \\begin{cases} \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)} &amp; \\text{$T \\le T_{std}^{phy}$} \\\\ \\\\ \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)} - \\left[\\theta_{prod}^{phy}\\right]^{kTn \\times \\left(T-aTn\\right)} + bTn &amp; \\text{$T_{std}^{phy} \\lt T \\le T_{max}^{phy}$} \\\\ \\\\ 0 &amp; \\text{$T_{max}^{phy} \\lt T$} \\end{cases} \\tag{J.8} \\end{equation}\\] The form of \\(L_{T}^{phy}\\) with varying \\(T\\) depends on three user specified (or default) temperatures and their derived quantities \\(aTn\\), \\(bTn\\) and \\(kTn\\). As such, the following two figures present \\(L_{T}^{phy}\\) varying with \\(T\\) and at constant \\(T_{max}^{phy}\\) = 25\\(^o\\)C, with the following conditions: Figure J.1: Line 1: \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) held constant at 10\\(^o\\)C, with the slider varying \\(T_{opt}^{phy}\\) Line 2: \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) held constant at 18\\(^o\\)C, with the slider varying \\(T_{opt}^{phy}\\) Figure J.2: Line 1: \\(T_{opt}^{phy}\\) held constant at 10\\(^o\\)C, with the slider varying \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) Line 2: \\(T_{opt}^{phy}\\) held constant at 18\\(^o\\)C, with the slider varying \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) Figure J.1: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(T_{opt}^{phy}\\) on the computed temperature limitation function Figure J.2: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(T_{std}^{phy}\\) on the computed temperature limitation function J.3 Nitrogen Nitrogen offers two limitation functions, one for each of the basic and advanced phytoplankton constituent models. These are described separately following. If nitrogen fixing is implemented for a particular phytoplankton group, then the calculations following are not implemented and \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\) is set to one. J.3.1 Basic phytoplankton constituent model If internal phytoplankton nutrients are not simulated dynamically, Equation (J.9) is used to compute \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{nit}^{phy} = \\frac{\\left(\\left[N\\right]_{avail} - \\left[N\\right]_{min}\\right)}{\\left(\\left[N\\right]_{avail} - \\left[N\\right]_{min}\\right) + K_{lim-N}^{phy}} \\tag{J.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\left[N\\right]_{avail}\\) is the available ambient nitrogen pool on which phytoplankton can draw for primary productivity, and is the sum of inorganic (ammonium and nitrate) nitrogen. \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}^{phy}\\) is the nitrogen concentration below which phytoplankton is no longer permitted to uptake nitrogen. \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) is the half saturation nitrogen concentration for phytoplankton uptake. All these parameters are considered by the WQM to be combined quantities, i.e. they are not specific to any particular nitrogen species, but rather, to nitrogen-N concentrations across all species uptaken. In the case of the basic phytoplankton constituent model, this is simply the sum of ammonium-N and nitrate-N concentrations. Equation (J.9) has that when \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) is equal to the difference between ambient nitrogen concentration and \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}\\), i.e. when \\[\\begin{equation} K_{lim-N}^{phy} = \\left[N\\right]_{avail} - \\left[N\\right]_{min} \\tag{J.10} \\end{equation}\\] then \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\) = 0.5. The form of \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\) with varying \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}\\) and \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) is provided in Figure J.3, for constant \\(\\left[N\\right]_{avail}\\) = 1.0 mg/L. Figure J.3: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) on the computed nitrogen limitation function The parameter \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) is the same as that specified in the computation of the the fraction of ammonium that is taken up with primary production (Appendix K.2.1) in the basic phytoplankton constituent model (Equation (K.3)). As such its setting should be considered in terms of its impacts on both nitrogen limitation and uptake processes. J.3.2 Advanced phytoplankton constituent model If internal phytoplankton nutrients are simulated dynamically, and phytoplankton concentrations are greater than the specified (or default) minimum, then Equation (J.11) is used to compute \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{nit}^{phy} = \\frac{X_{N-C-max}^{phy} \\times \\left(1.0 - \\frac{X_{N-C-min}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] }{\\left[N\\right]_{in}}\\right)}{X_{N-C-max}^{phy} - X_{N-C-min}^{phy}} \\tag{J.11} \\end{equation}\\] \\(X_{N-C-min}^{phy}\\) and \\(X_{N-C-max}^{phy}\\) are the specified (or default) minimum and maximum internal nitrogen to Chl a (or carbon if using mmm units) ratios, respectively and \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) and \\(\\left[N\\right]_{in}\\) are the current internal Chl a (or carbon) and nitrogen concentrations in the computational cell being considered, respectively. Substituting the definition for the minimum nitrogen to Chl a (or carbon) ratio \\(X_{N-C-min}^{phy}=\\left[N\\right]_{min}/\\left[PHY\\right]\\) (where \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is in either mgl or mmm units) into Equation (J.11) and rearranging, reveals the form of \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\) as per Equation (J.12). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{nit}^{phy} = \\frac{X_{N-C-max}^{phy} \\times \\left(1.0 - \\frac{\\left[N\\right]_{min}} {\\left[N\\right]_{in}}\\right)}{X_{N-C-max}^{phy} - X_{N-C-min}^{phy}} \\tag{J.12} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}\\) is the minimum internal nitrogen concentation corresponding to the current phytoplankton group \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\). Equation (J.12) demonstrates that: If an internal nitrogen concentration is equal to \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}\\), then \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\) is zero. This means that no internal nitrogen is available for primary production in the current timestep and that nitrogen is therefore completely preventing growth If an internal nitrogen concentration is equal to \\(\\left[N\\right]_{max}\\), then \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\) is one. This means that maximum internal nitrogen is available for primary production in the current timestep and that nitrogen is therefore placing no limit on growth If internal phytoplankton nutrients are simulated dynamically, and phytoplankton concentration is less than the specified (or default) minimum, then phytoplankton will look to external (i.e. ambient water column) nitrogen pools to support primary productivity. The associated limitation function is therefore computed in the same manner as Equation (J.9) in Appendix J.3.1. If this is the case, then the parameters \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) and \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}^{phy}\\) are used. This same parameter is also used in the computation of the nitrogen that is taken up with primary production (Appendix K.2.2) in the advanced phytoplankton constituent model (Equation (K.4)). As such its setting should be considered in terms of its impacts on both nitrogen limitation and uptake processes in the advanced phytoplankton constituent model. J.4 Phosphorus Phosphorus offers two limitation functions, one for each of the basic and advanced phytoplankton constituent models. These are described separately following. J.4.1 Basic phytoplankton constituent model If internal phytoplankton nutrients are not dynamically simulated, Equation (J.13) is used to compute \\(L_{phs}^{phy}\\). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{phs}^{phy} = \\frac{\\left(\\left[P\\right]_{avail} - \\left[P\\right]_{min}\\right)}{\\left(\\left[P\\right]_{avail} - \\left[P\\right]_{min}\\right) + K_{lim-P}^{phy}} \\tag{J.13} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\left[P\\right]_{avail}\\) is the available phosphorus pool on which phytoplankton can draw for primary productivity, and is simply FRP. \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}\\) is the phosphorus concentration below which phytoplankton no longer is permitted to uptake phosphorus \\(K_{lim-P}^{phy}\\) is the half saturation phosphorus concentration for phytoplankton uptake. Equation (J.13) has that when \\(K_{lim-P}^{phy}\\) is equal to the difference between ambient phosphorus concentration and \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}\\), i.e. when \\[\\begin{equation} K_{lim-P}^{phy} = \\left[P\\right]_{avail} - \\left[P\\right]_{min} \\tag{J.14} \\end{equation}\\] then \\(L_{phs}^{phy}\\) = 0.5. The form of \\(L_{phs}^{phy}\\) with varying \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}\\) and \\(K_{lim-P}^{phy}\\) is provided in Figure J.4, for constant \\(\\left[P\\right]_{avail}\\) = 1.0 mg/L. Figure J.4: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(K_{lim-P}^{phy}\\) on the computed phosphorus limitation function J.4.2 Advanced phytoplankton constituent model If internal phytoplankton nutrients are simulated dynamically, and phytoplankton concentrations are greater than the specified (or default) minimum, then Equation (J.15) is used to compute \\(L_{phs}^{phy}\\). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{phs}^{phy} = \\frac{X_{P-C-max}^{phy} \\times \\left(1.0 - \\frac{X_{P-C-min}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] }{\\left[P\\right]_{in}}\\right)}{X_{P-C-max}^{phy} - X_{P-C-min}^{phy}} \\tag{J.15} \\end{equation}\\] \\(X_{P-C-min}^{phy}\\) and \\(X_{P-C-max}^{phy}\\) are the specified (or default) minimum and maximum internal phosphorus to Chl a (or carbon if using mmm units) ratios, respectively and \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) and \\(\\left[P\\right]_{in}\\) are the current internal Chla a (or carbon) and phosphorus concentrations in the computational cell being considered, respectively. Substituting the definition for the minimum phosphorus to Chl a (or carbon) ratio \\(X_{P-C-min}^{phy}=\\left[P\\right]_{min}/\\left[PHY\\right]\\) (where \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is in either mgl or mmm units) into Equation (J.15) and rearranging, reveals the form of \\(L_{phs}^{phy}\\) as per Equation (J.16). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{phs}^{phy} = \\frac{X_{P-C-max}^{phy} \\times \\left(1.0 - \\frac{\\left[P\\right]_{min}} {\\left[P\\right]_{in}}\\right)}{X_{P-C-max}^{phy} - X_{P-C-min}^{phy}} \\tag{J.16} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}\\) is the minimum internal phosphorus concentation corresponding to the current \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\). Equation (J.16) demonstrates that: If an internal phosphorus concentration is equal to \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}\\), then \\(L_{phs}^{phy}\\) is zero. This means that no internal phosphorus is available for primary production in the current timestep and that phosphorus is therefore completely preventing growth If an internal phosphorus concentration is equal to \\(\\left[P\\right]_{max}\\), then \\(L_{phs}^{phy}\\) is one. This means that maximum internal phosphorus is available for primary production in the current timestep and that phosphorus is therefore placing no limit on growth If internal phytoplankton nutrients are simulated dynamically, and phytoplankton concentrations are less than the specified (or default) minimum, then phytoplankton will look to external (i.e. ambient water column) phosphorus pools to support primary productivity. The associated limitation function is therefore computed in the same manner as Equation (J.13) in Appendix J.4.1. If this is the case, then the parameters \\(K_{lim-P}^{phy}\\) and \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}^{phy}\\) are used. This same parameter is also used in the computation of the phosphorus that is taken up with primary production (Appendix K.3.2) in the advanced phytoplankton constituent model (Equation (K.8)). As such its setting should be considered in terms of its impacts on both phosphorus limitation and uptake processes in the advanced phytoplankton constituent model. J.5 Silicate Equation (J.17) is used to compute \\(L_{sil}^{phy}\\), if phytoplankton is configured to take up silicate. Specifying silicate limitation parameters will trigger the WQM to take up silicate (Section 4.7.3.5.1.6). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{sil}^{phy} = \\frac{\\left(\\left[Si\\right] - \\left[Si\\right]_{min}\\right)}{\\left(\\left[Si\\right] - \\left[Si\\right]_{min}\\right) + K_{lim-Si}^{phy}} \\tag{J.17} \\end{equation}\\] \\(\\left[Si\\right]\\) is the ambient silicate concentration. \\(\\left[Si\\right]_{min}\\) is the silicate concentration below which phytoplankton no longer is permitted to uptake silicate and \\(K_{lim-Si}^{phy}\\) is the half saturation silicate concentration for phytoplankton uptake. \\(K_{lim-Si}^{phy}\\) is specified as a silicate concentration. When this concentration is equal to the difference between the relevant ambient concentration and \\(\\left[Si\\right]_{min}\\), i.e. when \\[\\begin{equation} K_{lim-Si}^{phy} = \\left[Si\\right] - \\left[Si\\right]_{min} \\tag{J.18} \\end{equation}\\] then \\(L_{sil}^{phy}\\) = 0.5. The form of \\(L_{sil}^{phy}\\) with varying \\(\\left[Si\\right]_{min}\\) and \\(K_{lim-Si}^{phy}\\) is provided in Figure J.5, for constant \\(\\left[Si\\right]_{avail}\\) = 1.0 mg/L. Figure J.5: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(K_{lim-Si}^{phy}\\) on the computed silicate limitation function J.6 Light Phytoplankton require photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in order to affect primary productivity. The required PAR may not always be available due to a range of environmental factors and as such may limit phytoplankton growth. In addition, some phytoplankton groups may suffer photoinhibition, which is a reduction in the ability to photosynthesise as a result of damage incurred by greater levels of radiation than can be tolerated. This is also referred to as light-induced damage, and in general terms means that increasing light intensity experienced by a phytoplankton group does not translate into a monotonic increase in the light limitation function: primary productivity can decrease with increasing available light where photoinhibition occurs. A saturating light intensity \\(I_S\\) is specified for those models that include photoinhibition (rather then a half saturation light for limitation \\(I_K\\) specified for models that exclude photoinhibition) and \\(I_S\\) can be interpreted as the light intensity at which the limitation function has its peak, usually at a value of 1.0. Either side of this \\(I_S\\) light intensity, the limitation function decreases toward zero. The WQM offers a number of different models that deploy combinations of these processes to estimate phytoplankton light limitation functions. These are described following. J.6.1 Basic This model includes phytoplankton light limitation but with no photoinhibition. Limitation is therefore purely due to insufficient light availability. The limitation function \\(L_{lght}^{phy}\\) is computed within a model cell as per Equation (J.19). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{lght}^{phy} = 1.0 - \\left[ \\int_{\\frac{-PAR_b}{I_{K-bas}}}^{\\infty} \\! \\left( \\frac{e^{-t}}{t} \\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}t - \\int_{\\frac{-PAR_t}{I_{K-bas}}}^{\\infty} \\! \\left( \\frac{e^{-t}}{t} \\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right] \\times \\left[ \\vphantom{\\int_{\\frac{-PAR_b}{I_{K-bas}}}^{\\infty} \\! \\left( \\frac{e^{-t}}{t} \\right)\\, \\mathrm{d}t} \\frac{1}{\\text{max}(k_{bio}\\times dz,10^{-3})}\\right] \\tag{J.19} \\end{equation}\\] \\(PAR_b\\) and \\(PAR_t\\) are photosynthetically available radiation at the bottom and top faces of a model cell, respectively, \\(I_{K-bas}\\) is the half saturation constant for light limitation of growth, \\(\\text{k}_\\text{bio}\\) is the local change in light extinction coefficient due to self shading and \\(dz\\) is cell vertical thickness. J.6.2 Monod This model includes phytoplankton light limitation but with no photoinhibition, as per Monod (1950). Limitation is therefore purely due to insufficient light availability. The limitation function \\(L_{lght}^{phy}\\) is computed within a model cell as per Equation (J.20). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{lght}^{phy} = \\frac{\\frac{PAR_c}{I_{K-mon}}}{1 + \\frac{PAR_c}{I_{K-mon}}} \\tag{J.20} \\end{equation}\\] \\(PAR_c\\) is the photosynthetically available radiation at the centre of a model cell and \\(I_{K-mon}\\) is the half saturation constant for light limitation of growth. Equation (J.20) has that when \\(PAR_c\\) is equal to \\(I_{K-mon}\\), \\(L_{lght}^{phy}\\) = 0.5. J.6.3 Steele This model includes phytoplankton light limitation with photoinhibition, as per Steele (1962). The limitation function \\(L_{lght}^{phy}\\) is computed within a model cell as per Equation (J.21). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{lght}^{phy} = \\frac{PAR_c}{I_{S-ste}} \\times e^{\\left(1.0 - \\frac{PAR_c}{I_{S-ste}}\\right)} \\tag{J.21} \\end{equation}\\] \\(PAR_c\\) is the photosynthetically available radiation at the centre of a model cell and \\(I_{S-ste}\\) is the saturating light intensity. Equation (J.21) has that when \\(PAR_c\\) is equal to \\(I_{S-ste}\\), \\(L_{lght}^{phy}\\) = 1.0, i.e., the light intensity at which no light limitation or photoinhibition occurs.

Figure J.6: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(I_S\\) on the computed light limitation function J.6.4 Webb This model includes phytoplankton light limitation with no photoinhibition, as per Webb (1974).

Figure J.8: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(I_K\\) on the computed light limitation function J.6.6 Chalker This model includes phytoplankton light limitation with no photoinhibition, as per Chalker (1980). The limitation function \\(L_{lght}^{phy}\\) is computed within a model cell as per Equation (J.24). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{lght}^{phy} = \\frac{e^{1.5\\left(\\frac{PAR_c}{I_{K-cha}}\\right)}-1.0}{e^{1.5\\left(\\frac{PAR_c}{I_{K-cha}}\\right)}+0.5} \\tag{J.24} \\end{equation}\\] \\(PAR_c\\) is the photosynthetically available radiation at the centre of a model cell and \\(I_{K-cha}\\) is the half saturation constant for light limitation of growth.

Figure J.10: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(I_S\\) on the computed light limitation function J.6.8 Integrated This model includes phytoplankton light limitation with photoinhibition, and is the integrated form of the Steele (1962) model provided in Equation (J.21). In this form, the limitation function \\(L_{lght}^{phy}\\) is computed within a model cell as per Equation (J.26). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{lght}^{phy} = \\frac{e^{\\left(1.0 - \\frac{PAR_b}{I_{S-int}}\\right)} - e^{\\left(1.0 - \\frac{PAR_t}{I_{S-int}}\\right)}}{\\text{k}_\\text{bio} \\times dz} \\tag{J.26} \\end{equation}\\] \\(PAR_b\\) and \\(PAR_t\\) are photosynthetically available radiation at the bottom and top faces of a model cell, respectively, \\(I_{S-int}\\) is the saturating light intensity, \\(\\text{k}_\\text{bio}\\) is the local change in light extinction coefficient due to self shading and \\(dz\\) is cell vertical thickness. J.7 Salinity Phytoplankton can exhibit sensitivity to salinity. Where activated, the WQM captures these sensitivities via multiplicative application of a salinity limitation function to relevant rates (Equation (I.4) and Equation (I.7)). One way to conceptualise this is as follows: A salinity limitation value less than one applied to phytoplankton primary productivity at a particular salinity will result in a reduction in primary productivity. Corresponding respiration rates will remain unaffected by salinity and therefore by Equation (I.1), phytoplankton biomass should be expected to decrease as a result A salinity limitation value less than one applied to phytoplankton respiration at a particular salinity will result in a reduction in respiration. Corresponding primary productivity rates will remain unaffected by salinity and therefore by Equation (I.1), phytoplankton biomass should be expected to increase as a result, noting however that exudation (which is another loss term) will continue and is related to primary productivity. The salinity limitation models available within the WQM are described following. J.7.1 None This model includes no salinity limitation to either of the computed primary productivity or respiration rates. The salinity limitation set to 1.0 for all salinities. J.7.2 Freshwater This model is typically used for phytoplankton groups that have a preference for fresh waters. As such, the salinity limitation is set to 1.0 for all salinities greater than zero and up to a specified (or default) optimal salinity. Above this optimal salinity, the limitation function decreases from 1.0 to a specified (or default) limitation function value at a specified (or default) maximum salinity. For salinities greater than optimal, the limitation function \\(L_{sal}^{phy}\\) is computed within a model cell as per Equation (J.27). \\[\\begin{equation} \\left.\\begin{aligned} L_{sal}^{phy} =&amp; \\left(\\frac{\\left(L^{phy}_{max-fresh}-1.0\\right)\\times S^2 - \\left(\\left(L^{phy}_{max-fresh}-1.0\\right) \\times 2.0 \\times S_{opt-fresh}^{phy}\\right)\\times S}{\\left(S_{max-fresh}^{phy} - S_{opt-fresh}^{phy}\\right)^2}\\right) + \\ldots \\\\ \\\\ &amp; \\ldots \\left(\\frac{\\left(\\left(L^{phy}_{max-fresh}-1.0\\right) \\times \\left(S_{opt-fresh}^{phy}\\right)^2\\right)}{\\left(S_{max-fresh}^{phy} - S_{opt-fresh}^{phy}\\right)^2}\\right) + 1.0 \\end{aligned}\\right\\} \\tag{J.27} \\end{equation}\\] \\(S_{opt-fresh}^{phy}\\) and \\(S_{max-fresh}^{phy}\\) are the optimal and maximum salinities respectively, \\(L^{phy}_{max-fresh}\\) is the value of the salinity limitation function at \\(S_{max-fresh}^{phy}\\) and \\(S\\) is ambient salinity. The intention of applying this salinity limitation function is that it be used to set \\(L^{phy}_{max-fresh}\\) as zero at the salinity above which a phytoplankton group is known to be entirely inhibited by salinity. For example, if a particular phytoplankton group was known to feel the effects of salinity above a salinity of 5 g/L, and to entirely cease functioning at salinities greater than 10 g/L, then the following would be set by the user: \\(S_{opt-fresh}^{phy}\\) = 5.0 g/L \\(S_{max-fresh}^{phy}\\) = 10.0 g/L, and \\(L^{phy}_{max-fresh}\\) = 0.0 Using these values but varying \\(S_{max-fresh}^{phy}\\), the form of Equation (J.27) is presented in Figure J.11.

As such, the salinity limitation is set to 1.0 for all salinities greater than a specified (or default) optimal salinity. Below this optimal salinity, the limitation function decreases from 1.0 to a specified (or default) limitation function value at zero salinity. For salinities less than optimal, the limitation function \\(L_{sal}^{phy}\\) is computed within a model cell as per Equation (J.28). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{sal}^{phy} = \\left(\\frac{\\left(L^{phy}_{zero}-1.0\\right)\\times S^2}{\\left(S_{opt-marine}^{phy}\\right)^2}\\right) - \\left(2.0 \\times \\frac{\\left(L^{phy}_{zero}-1.0\\right)\\times S}{\\left(S_{opt-marine}^{phy}\\right)}\\right) + L^{phy}_{zero} \\tag{J.28} \\end{equation}\\] \\(S_{opt-marine}^{phy}\\) is the optimal salinity , \\(L^{phy}_{zero}\\) is the value of the salinity limitation function at zero salinity and \\(S\\) is ambient salinity. The intention of applying this limitation function is that it be used to set \\(L^{phy}_{zero}\\) equal to zero at zero salinity, and to set \\(S_{opt-marine}^{phy}\\) as the point below which a phytoplankton group begins to be salinity inhibited. For example, if a particular phytoplankton group was known to begin being inhibited below a salinity of 20 g/L, then the following would be set by the user: \\(S_{opt-marine}^{phy}\\) = 20.0 g/L \\(L^{phy}_{zero}\\) = 0.0 Using these values but varying \\(S_{opt-marine}^{phy}\\), the form of Equation (J.28) is presented in Figure J.12. Figure J.12: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(S_{opt-marine}^{phy}\\) on the computed salinity limitation function. \\(L^{phy}_{zero}\\) = 0.0 and is fixed J.7.4 Mixed This model is typically used for phytoplankton groups that have a preference for mid range salinity waters. As such, the salinity limitation is set to 1.0 between specified (or default) optimal and maximum salinities, with the function decreasing either side of these salinities to a specified (or default) value at zero, and the sum of optimal and maximum salinities. The limitation function \\(L_{sal}^{phy}\\) is computed within a model cell as per Equation (J.29). \\[\\begin{equation} L_{sal}^{phy} = \\begin{cases} \\left(\\frac{\\left(L^{phy}_{zero-mix}-1.0\\right)\\times S^2}{\\left(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\right)^2}\\right) - \\left(2.0 \\times \\frac{\\left(L^{phy}_{zero-mix}-1.0\\right)\\times S}{\\left(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\right)}\\right) + L^{phy}_{zero-mix} &amp; \\text{$S \\le S_{opt-mix}^{phy}$} \\\\ \\\\ 1.0 &amp; \\text{$S_{opt-mix}^{phy} \\lt S \\le S_{max-mix}^{phy}$} \\\\ \\\\ \\left(\\frac{\\left(L^{phy}_{zero-mix}-1.0\\right)\\times \\left(S_{max-mix}^{phy} + S_{opt-mix}^{phy} - S\\right)^2}{\\left(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\right)^2}\\right) - \\ldots \\\\ \\ldots \\left(2.0 \\times \\frac{\\left(L^{phy}_{zero-mix}-1.0\\right)\\times \\left(S_{max-mix}^{phy} + S_{opt-mix}^{phy} - S\\right)}{\\left(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\right)}\\right) + L^{phy}_{zero-mix} &amp; \\text{$S_{max-mix}^{phy} \\lt S \\le \\left(S_{max-mix}^{phy} + S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\right)$} \\\\ \\\\ L^{phy}_{zero-mix} &amp; \\text{$\\left(S_{max-mix}^{phy} + S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\right) \\lt S$} \\end{cases} \\tag{J.29} \\end{equation}\\] \\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\) and \\(S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\) are the optimal and maximum salinities, respectively, \\(L^{phy}_{zero-mix}\\) is the value of the salinity limitation function at salinities of zero and greater than (\\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy} + S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\)) and \\(S\\) is ambient salinity. The intention of applying this limitation function is that it be used to set \\(L^{phy}_{zero-mix}\\) equal to zero at high and low salinities, and to set a range of intermediate salinities (between \\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\) and \\(S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\)) where the limitation function is one. Outside this intermediate range, a phytoplankton group begins to experience inhibition and limitation function values decrease. For example, if a particular phytoplankton group was known to prefer salinities between 5 and 10 g/L, then the following would be set by the user: \\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\) = 5.0 g/L \\(S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\) = 10.0 g/L \\(L^{phy}_{zero-mix}\\) = 0.0 Using these values but varying \\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\), the form of Equation (J.29) is presented in Figure J.13. The absolute range between \\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\) and \\(S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\) is held constant at 5.0 g/L for ease of comparison, so \\(S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\) increases at the same rate as \\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\) when the slider moves. Figure J.13: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\) on the computed salinity limitation function. \\(L^{phy}_{zero-mix}\\) = 0.0 and is fixed. \\(S_{max-mix}^{phy}\\) is set to be \\(S_{opt-mix}^{phy}\\) + 5.0 g/L J.7.5 Estuarine This model is typically used for phytoplankton groups that have a preference for mid range salinity (typically estuarine) waters. As such, the salinity limitation is set to one at a specified (or default) optimal mid range salinity, and decreases either side of that salinity. At higher salinities, the limitation function decreases to zero by a specified (or default) maximum salinity (and it stays at zero above this maximum), and at lower salinities it decreases at a rate determined by a specified (or default) power coefficient. The limitation function \\(L_{sal}^{phy}\\) is computed within a model cell as per Equation (J.30), with the applicable salinity ranges of each piecewise function being \\(S \\le S_{max-est}^{phy}\\) and \\(S_{max-est}^{phy} \\lt S\\), respectively. \\[\\begin{equation} L_{sal}^{phy} = \\begin{cases} e^{P^{phy}_{est}\\left(S-S_{opt-est}^{phy}\\right)} \\times \\left( \\frac{\\left(S_{max-est}^{phy}-S\\right)}{\\left(S_{max-est}^{phy}-S_{opt-est}^{phy}\\right)}\\right)^{P^{phy}_{est}\\left(S_{max-est}^{phy}-S_{opt-est}^{phy}\\right)} &amp; \\text{$S \\le S_{max-est}^{phy}$} \\\\ \\\\ 0.0 &amp; \\text{$S_{max-est}^{phy} \\lt S$} \\\\ \\\\ \\end{cases} \\tag{J.30} \\end{equation}\\] \\(S_{opt-est}^{phy}\\) and \\(S_{max-est}^{phy}\\) are the optimal and maximum salinities, respectively, \\(P^{phy}_{est}\\) is the power coefficient and \\(S\\) is ambient salinity. The intention of applying this limitation function is that it be applied to a relatively narrow band of mid range (estuarine) salinities. For example, if a particular phytoplankton group was known to grow optimally at a salinity of 15 g/L but was completely suppressed less than 5 g/L and greater than 20 g/L, then the following would be set by the user: \\(S_{opt-est}^{phy}\\) = 15.0 g/L \\(S_{max-est}^{phy}\\) = 20.0 g/L \\(P^{phy}_{est}\\) = 3.0 Using these values but varying \\(P^{phy}_{est}\\), the form of Equation (J.30) is presented in Figure J.14. \\(S_{opt-est}^{phy}\\) and \\(S_{max-est}^{phy}\\) are held constant at 15.0 g/L and 20 g/L, respectively. The slider starts at a \\(P^{phy}_{est}\\) value of 0.2, and the key feature to note is that the salinity limitation function distribution tightens as \\(P^{phy}_{est}\\) increases. Figure J.14: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(P^{phy}_{est}\\) on the computed salinity limitation function. \\(S_{opt-est}^{phy}\\) and \\(S_{max-est}^{phy}\\) are set to be 15 and 20 g/L, respectively, and are fixed "],["PhyUptake-3.html", "Appendix K Processes: phyto uptake K.1 Carbon K.2 Nitrogen K.3 Phosphorus K.4 Silicate", " Appendix K Processes: phyto uptake Once the primary productivity \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) rate has been computed for a phytoplankton group via Equation (I.2) (and potentially Equations (I.3) and (I.4) if nitrogen fixing and salinity limitation are activated, respectively), then that rate drives the mass uptake of inorganic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and silicate. This uptake includes the operation of a number of user specified (or default) parameters, and the respective calculations are described following. Uptakes are denoted as fluxes, \\(F\\). K.1 Carbon Carbon has the simplest uptake calculation, as per Equation (K.1). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{C-uptake}^{phy} = R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\tag{K.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{C-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the uptake of carbon, \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) is the computed primary productivity rate and \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is a computational cells phytoplankton concentration. This flux is summed over all simulated phytoplankton groups to compute the community carbon uptake, \\(F_{C-uptake\\langle computed\\rangle}^{comm}\\). Carbon does not need to be explicitly simulated as a computed variable for this uptake to occur, but because carbon is used as the units of accounting for phytoplankton biomass, its uptake is computed by the WQM in order to report phytoplankton concentrations. These concentrations are either mmol C per m\\(^3\\) or \\(\\mu\\)g chlorophyll a per litre (using a specified or default conversion), depending on the specified simulation units system. Carbon stores from which phytoplankton uptake can draw are assumed to be unlimited and unaccounted for when carbon is not explicitly included in a simulation as a computed variable. K.2 Nitrogen The WQM allows for phytoplankton to uptake nitrate and ammonium (i.e. inorganic nitrogen) to meet primary production nitrogen demands. The parallel uptake of organic nitrogen (i.e. simulation of mixotrophic phytoplankton) is not yet implemented within the WQM. Uptake is computed differently for the basic and advanced phytoplankton constituent models K.2.1 Basic phytoplankton constituent model If internal phytoplankton nutrients are not simulated dynamically, nitrogen uptake is calculated as per Equation (K.2). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{N-uptake}^{phy} = R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\times X_{N-C-con}^{phy} \\tag{K.2} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{N-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the uptake of water column inorganic nitrogen, \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) is the computed primary productivity rate, \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is a computational cells phytoplankton concentration and \\(X_{N-C-con}^{phy}\\) is the specified (or default) constant ratio of internal nitrogen to carbon in the phytoplankton group being considered. This quantity \\(F_{N-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the total uptake of inorganic nitrogen. In order to disaggregate this uptake into that of ammonium and nitrate, the WQM applies Equation (K.3), for ammonium concentrations greater than zero. \\[\\begin{equation} \\left.\\begin{aligned} f_{amm-uptake}^{phy} =&amp; \\frac{\\left[NH_4\\right]\\times\\left[NO_3\\right]}{\\left(\\left[NH_4\\right] + K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\right)\\times\\left(\\left[NO_3\\right]+K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\right)} + \\frac{\\left[NH_4\\right]\\times K_{lim-N}^{phy}}{\\left(\\left[NH_4\\right] + \\left[NO_3\\right]\\right)\\times\\left(\\left[NO_3\\right]+K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\right)} \\\\ \\\\ F_{amm-uptake}^{phy} =&amp; F_{N-uptake}^{phy} \\times f_{amm-uptake}^{phy} \\\\ \\\\ F_{nit-uptake}^{phy} =&amp; F_{N-uptake}^{phy} \\times \\left(1.0 - f_{amm-uptake}^{phy}\\right) \\end{aligned}\\right\\} \\tag{K.3} \\end{equation}\\] For a phytoplankton group, \\(f_{amm-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the fraction of nitrogen uptake that is ammonium, \\(\\left[NH_4\\right]\\) and \\(\\left[NO_3\\right]\\) are the ambient water column ammonium and nitrate concentrations, respectively, \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) is the half saturation nitrogen concentration for phytoplankton uptake and \\(F_{amm-uptake}^{phy}\\) and \\(F_{nit-uptake}^{phy}\\) are the uptake by phytoplankton of ammonium and nitrate, respectively. These fluxes (whether computed from Equation (K.3) or (K.4)) are summed over all simulated phytoplankton groups to compute the community ammonium and nitrate uptake, \\(F_{amm-uptake\\langle computed\\rangle}^{comm}\\) and \\(F_{nit-uptake\\langle computed\\rangle}^{comm}\\), respectively. The form of \\(f_{amm-uptake}^{phy}\\) in Equation (K.3) with ammonium concentration is presented in Figure K.1. Use the play button or drag the slider to see how different half saturation concentrations \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) change the fraction of ammonium taken up by phytoplankton (ordinate), as a function of ambient ammonium concentration (abscissa). Nitrate concentration is set to a fixed 5 mg/L. Figure K.1: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) on the fraction of ammonium taken up by phytoplankton. Nitrate concentration is set to 5 mg/L and is fixed To complement Figure K.1, the form of \\(f_{amm-uptake}^{phy}\\) in Equation (K.3) with nitrate concentration is presented in Figure K.2, using the same ordinate axis limits. Use the play button or drag the slider to see how different half saturation concentrations \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) change the fraction of ammonium taken up by phytoplankton (ordinate), as a function of ambient nitrate concentration (abscissa). Ammonium concentration is set to a fixed 2 mg/L. Figure K.2: Move the slider to see the effect of changing \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) on the fraction of ammonium taken up by phytoplankton. Ammonium concentration is set to 2 mg/L and is fixed The parameter [\\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\)] is the same as that used for calculation of the nitrogen limitation function in the basic (and advanced if internal nitrogen stores are exhausted) phytoplankton constituent model, so its specification should be considered in terms of its influence on both uptake on limitation. K.2.2 Advanced phytoplankton constituent model If internal phytoplankton nutrients are simulated dynamically, nitrogen uptake is calculated as per Equation (K.4). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{N-uptake}^{phy} = R_{N-uptake}^{phy} \\times L_{T}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\times \\frac{\\left(X_{N-C-max}^{phy} - \\frac{\\left[N\\right]_{in}}{\\left[PHY\\right]}\\right)}{\\left(X_{N-C-max}^{phy} - X_{N-C-min}^{phy}\\right)} \\times \\frac{\\left(\\left[N\\right]_{avail} - \\left[N\\right]_{min}\\right)}{\\left(\\left[N\\right]_{avail} - \\left[N\\right]_{min}\\right) + K_{lim-N}^{phy}} \\tag{K.4} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{N-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the uptake of water column inorganic nitrogen, \\(R_{N-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the specified (or default) rate of uptake of inorganic nitrogen, \\(L_{T}^{phy}\\) is the temperature limitation function, \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) and \\(\\left[N\\right]_{in}\\) are a computational cells phytoplankton and internal nitrogen concentrations respectively, \\(X_{N-C-min}^{phy}\\) and \\(X_{N-C-max}^{phy}\\) are the specified (or default) minimum and maximum ratios of internal nitrogen to carbon in the phytoplankton group being considered, respectively, \\(\\left[N\\right]_{avail}\\) is the available (water column) nitrogen pool on which phytoplankton can draw for primary productivity, and is the sum of inorganic (ammonium and nitrate) nitrogen, \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}\\) is the nitrogen concentration below which phytoplankton is no longer permitted to uptake nitrogen and \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) is the half saturation nitrogen concentration for phytoplankton uptake. These last three parameters (and the last term in Equation (K.4)) are the same as that applied to the basic phytoplankton constituent model as per Equation (K.2), via calculation of the limitation function applied to \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) (as per Equation (J.9)). Equation (K.4) reveals the following: The uptake of water column nitrogen to internal phytoplankton stores is governed by the specified (or default) nitrogen uptake rate This rate is modified by Temperature, using the specified (or default) temperature limitation model for uptake (Section J.2) The current internal nitrogen concentrations, relative to the specified (or default) minima and maxima Ambient water column inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and The half saturation nitrogen concentration for uptake, which is the same parameter as used in the basic phytoplankton constituent model If for example the internal nitrogen concentration \\(\\left[N\\right]_{in}\\) at a particular timestep and computational cell is equal to \\(X_{N-C-max}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right]\\), then Equation (K.4) has that internal nitrogen stores are full and that uptake is therefore zero. Conversely, if \\(\\left[N\\right]_{in}\\) at a particular timestep and computational cell is equal to \\(X_{N-C-min}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right]\\), then internal nitrogen stores are at their lowest and therefore (in themselves) do not limit uptake of water column nitrogen. Finally, if the available water column nitrogen \\(\\left[N\\right]_{avail}\\) is equal to the specified (or default) minimum allowable nitrogen concentration for uptake \\(\\left[N\\right]_{min}\\), then uptake to internal nutrient stores is zero. If uptake from the water column to internal stores occurs, then the split between ammonium and nitrate uptake is computed as per Equation (K.3). The parameter \\(K_{lim-N}^{phy}\\) is the same as that used for calculation of the nitrogen limitation function in the advanced phytoplankton constituent model if internal nitrogen stores are exhausted, so its specification should be considered in terms of its influence on both uptake on limitation. K.2.3 Nitrogen fixing If nitrogen fixing by phytoplankton is simulated, then a modification to the above computed nitrogen uptakes (for both the basic and advanced phytoplankton constituent models) is applied. The flux of atmospheric nitrogen is computed as per Equation (K.5). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{N-fix}^{phy} = R_{N-fix}^{phy} \\times \\left(1.0 - L_{nit}^{phy}\\right) \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\tag{K.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{N-fix}^{phy}\\) is the fixing of atmospheric nitrogen, \\(R_{N-fix}^{phy}\\) is the specified (or default) rate of nitrogen fixing, \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\) is the nitrogen limitation function computed via either Equation (J.9) or (J.11) for the basic and advanced phytoplankton constituent models, respectively, before \\(L_{nit}^{phy}\\) is set to one. Once computed, \\(F_{N-uptake}^{phy}\\) is modified as follows: If \\(|F_{N-fix}^{phy}| \\ge |F_{N-uptake}^{phy}|\\) then all uptake is assigned to \\(F_{N-fix}^{phy}\\), and \\(F_{N-uptake}^{phy}\\) is set to zero. If If \\(|F_{N-fix}^{phy}| \\le |F_{N-uptake}^{phy}|\\) then nitrogen water column uptake is reduced as per Equation (K.6). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{N-uptake\\langle computed \\rangle}^{phy} = F_{N-uptake}^{phy} \\times \\frac{\\left(|F_{N-uptake}^{phy}| - F_{N-fix}^{phy}\\right)}{|F_{N-uptake}^{phy}|} \\tag{K.6} \\end{equation}\\] Equation (K.6) is a simple linearisation that maps \\(F_{N-uptake\\langle computed \\rangle}^{phy}\\) to a value between 0.0 (where \\(F_{N-fix}^{phy} = F_{N-uptake}^{phy}\\)) and \\(F_{N-uptake\\langle computed \\rangle}^{phy}\\) (where \\(F_{N-fix}^{phy}\\) is zero). K.3 Phosphorus The WQM allows for phytoplankton to uptake free reactive phosphorus (i.e. inorganic phosphorus, FRP) to meet primary production phosphorus demands. The parallel uptake of organic phosphorus (i.e. simulation of mixotrophic phytoplankton) is not yet implemented within the WQM. Uptake is computed differently for the basic and advanced phytoplankton constituent models K.3.1 Basic phytoplankton constituent model If internal phytoplankton nutrients are not simulated dynamically, phosphorus uptake is calculated as per Equation (K.7). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{P-uptake}^{phy} = R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\times X_{P-C-con}^{phy} \\tag{K.7} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{P-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the uptake of inorganic phosphorus, \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) is the computed primary productivity rate, \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is a computational cells phytoplankton concentration and \\(X_{P-C-con}^{phy}\\) is the specified (or default) constant ratio of internal phosphorus to carbon in the phytoplankton group being considered. This flux (whether computed from Equation (K.7) or (K.8)) is summed over all simulated phytoplankton groups to compute the community FRP uptake, \\(F_{P-uptake\\langle computed\\rangle}^{comm}\\). K.3.2 Advanced phytoplankton constituent model If internal phytoplankton nutrients are simulated dynamically, phosphorus uptake is calculated as per Equation (K.8). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{P-uptake}^{phy} = R_{P-uptake}^{phy} \\times L_{T}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\times \\frac{\\left(X_{P-C-max}^{phy} - \\frac{\\left[P\\right]_{in}}{\\left[PHY\\right]}\\right)}{\\left(X_{P-C-max}^{phy} - X_{P-C-min}^{phy}\\right)} \\times \\frac{\\left(\\left[P\\right]_{avail} - \\left[P\\right]_{min}\\right)}{\\left(\\left[P\\right]_{avail} - \\left[P\\right]_{min}\\right) + K_{lim-P}^{phy}} \\tag{K.8} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{P-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the uptake of water column FRP, \\(R_{P-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the specified (or default) rate of uptake of FRP, \\(L_{T}^{phy}\\) is the temperature limitation function, \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) and \\(\\left[P\\right]_{in}\\) are a computational cells phytoplankton and internal phosphorus concentrations respectively, \\(X_{P-C-min}^{phy}\\) and \\(X_{P-C-max}^{phy}\\) are the specified (or default) minimum and maximum ratios of internal phosphorus to carbon in the phytoplankton group being considered, respectively, \\(\\left[P\\right]_{avail}\\) is the available (i.e. ambient water column) FRP pool on which phytoplankton can draw for primary productivity, \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}\\) is the FRP concentration below which phytoplankton is no longer permitted to uptake phosphorus and \\(K_{lim-P}^{phy}\\) is the half saturation FRP concentration for phytoplankton uptake. These last three parameters (and the last term in Equation (K.8)) are the same as that applied to the basic phytoplankton constituent model as per Equation (K.7), via calculation of the limitation function applied to \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) (as per Equation (J.13)). Equation (K.8) reveals the following: The uptake of water column FRP to internal phytoplankton stores is governed by the specified (or default) phosphorus uptake rate This rate is modified by Temperature, using the specified (or default) temperature limitation model for uptake (Section J.2) The current internal phosphorus concentrations, relative to the specified (or default) minima and maxima Ambient water column FRP concentrations, and The half saturation phosphorus concentration for uptake, which is the same parameter as used in the basic phytoplankton constituent model If for example the internal phosphorus concentration \\(\\left[P\\right]_{in}\\) at a particular timestep and computational cell is equal to \\(X_{P-C-max}^{phy}\\times \\left[PHY\\right]\\), then Equation (K.8) has that internal phosphorus stores are full and that uptake is therefore zero. Conversely, if \\(\\left[P\\right]_{in}\\) at a particular timestep and computational cell is equal to \\(X_{P-C-min}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right]\\), then internal phosphorus stores are at their lowest and therefore (in themselves) do not limit uptake of water column FRP. Finally, if the available water column FRP \\(\\left[P\\right]_{avail}\\) is equal to the specified (or default) minimum allowable FRP concentration for uptake \\(\\left[P\\right]_{min}\\), then uptake to internal nutrient stores is zero. The parameter \\(K_{lim-P}^{phy}\\) is the same as that used for calculation of the phosphorus limitation function in the advanced phytoplankton constituent model if internal phosphorus stores are exhausted, so its specification should be considered in terms of its influence on both uptake on limitation. K.4 Silicate The WQM allows for phytoplankton to uptake silicate to meet primary production demands, for phytoplankton groups that require silicate. Silicate uptake is calculated as per Equation (K.9). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{Si-uptake}^{phy} = R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\times X_{Si-C-con}^{phy} \\tag{K.9} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{Si-uptake}^{phy}\\) is the uptake of silicate, \\(R_{prod\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) is the computed primary productivity rate, \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is a computational cells phytoplankton concentration and \\(X_{Si-C-con}^{phy}\\) is the specified (or default) constant ratio of internal silicate to carbon in the phytoplankton group being considered.

These losses are computed using a number of user specified (or default) parameters, and for each relevant computed variable, comprise the following: Excretion loss: Computed from a combination of respiration and exudation rates (\\(R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) and \\(R_{exud\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\), respectively), and Mortality loss: Computed from the respiration rate \\(R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) The specifics of the calculation of each relevant computed variables excretion and mortality are described following.

As with primary productivity, carbon does not need to be explicitly simulated as a computed variable for these losses to occur, but because carbon is used as the units of accounting for phytoplankton biomass, its losses are computed by the WQM in order to report phytoplankton concentrations. Carbon stores to which the phytoplankton losses in Equations (L.1) and (L.2) deliver are assumed to be unlimited when carbon is not explicitly included in a simulation as a computed variable.

This is consistent with interpreting \\(f_{true-resp}^{phy}\\) as the fraction of respiration that is associated only with the re-release of energy through metabolism of carbon biomass generated and stored during antecedent phytoplanktonic photosynthesis Conversely, if \\(f_{true-resp}^{phy}\\) is set to 0.0, then (potentially unrealistically) respiration does not re-release any energy, but rather, sees the entire respiration rate expended on excretion of carbon biomass (subject to the value of \\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\\)) If \\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\\) is set to 1.0, then mortality losses are zero. This is consistent with interpreting this parameter as the proportion of combined excretive and mortality losses that are excretive. The converse applies for a \\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\\) of 0.0 Intermediate behaviours to the above limits can be inferred through interacting with Figures L.1 and L.2.

This is consistent with interpreting this parameter as the proportion of combined excretive and mortality losses that are excretive. The converse applies for a \\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\\) of 0.0. L.3 Phosphorus Equation (L.5) describes the calculation of excretion losses. \\[\\begin{equation} F_{P-excr}^{phy} = \\left(\\left(f_{excr-loss}^{phy} \\times R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\right) + R_{exud\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\right) \\times X_{P-C}^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\tag{L.5} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{P-excr}^{phy}\\) is the excretive loss of phosphorus, \\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\\) is the fraction of combined excretive and mortality losses that is excretive only, \\(R_{resp\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) and and \\(R_{exud\\langle computed\\rangle}^{phy}\\) are the computed respiration and exudation rates, respectively, and \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is a computational cells phytoplankton concentration.

This is consistent with interpreting this parameter as the proportion of combined excretive and mortality losses that are excretive. The converse applies for a \\(f_{excr-loss}^{phy}\\) of 0.0 Despite not simulating particulate silicate, Equations (L.7) and (L.8) nonetheless ensure that the mass of silicate delivered to the dissolved pool (that is simulated by the WQM) is consistent with that of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus.

The WQM allows, however, for modification of this TUFLOW field to incorporate the effect of light attenuation due to the presence of phytoplankton. This additional light extinction is computed dynamically at each water quality timestep, based on instantaneous phytoplanktonic concentrations in individual computational cells, as per Equation (M.1). \\[\\begin{equation} Ke_{\\langle computed \\rangle}^{phy} = Ke^{phy} \\times \\left[PHY\\right] \\tag{M.1} \\end{equation}\\] For each phytoplankton group, \\(Ke^{phy}\\) is the user specified (or default) self shading coefficient and \\(\\left[PHY\\right]\\) is the instantaneous phytoplankton concentration in each cell.

In all cases, this flux is most commonly out of the sediments, i.e. a positive specification of sediment flux. Although it is rare that sediments act as sinks of these species, TUFLOW WQM can be parameterised to allow for this if required. Only labile dissolved organic matter is released from the sediments in the WQM, and as such, references to organics in this section should be interpreted as labile organics. Sediment fluxes of particulate organic matter cannot be specified using this approach. Exchange of particulate organic matter between the sediments and water column is simulated using the TUFLOW FV sediment transport module. See Section XXXX . The user specified rates of dissolved organic fluxes (which can be spatially varying) are modified by overlying ambient dissolved oxygen concentration (together with respective user specified half saturation oxygen concentrations) and water temperature. These modifications are simulated via Michaelis-Menten and Arrhenius models, respectively, as per Equation (N.1). \\[\\begin{equation} \\left.\\begin{aligned} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagDOCSedFlx}{F_{sed\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC}} =&amp; F_{sed}^{DOC} \\times \\frac{K_{sed-O_2}^{DOM}}{K_{sed-O_2}^{DOM} + \\left[DO\\right]} \\times \\hphantom{\\text{ab}} \\left[\\theta_{sed}^{DOM}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)} \\\\ \\\\ \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagDONSedFlx}{F_{sed\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DON}} =&amp; F_{sed}^{DON} \\times \\frac{K_{sed-O_2}^{DOM}}{K_{sed-O_2}^{DOM} + \\left[DO\\right]} \\times \\hphantom{\\text{ab}} \\left[\\theta_{sed}^{DOM}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)} \\\\ \\\\ \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagDOPSedFlx}{F_{sed\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOP}} =&amp; F_{sed}^{DOP} \\times \\underbrace{\\frac{K_{sed-O_2}^{DOM}}{K_{sed-O_2}^{DOM} + \\left[DO\\right]}}_{\\text{Influence of oxygen}} \\times \\underbrace{\\vphantom{\\frac{\\left[DO\\right]}{K_{sed-O_2}^{NO_3} + \\left[DO\\right]}} \\left[\\theta_{sed}^{DOM}\\right]^{\\left(T-20\\right)}}_{\\text{Influence of temperature}} \\end{aligned}\\right\\} \\tag{N.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\(F_{sed}^{DOC}\\), \\(F_{sed}^{DON}\\) and \\(F_{sed}^{DOP}\\) are the user specified dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus sediment fluxes at 20\\(^o\\)C without the influence of dissolved oxygen, \\(\\left[DO\\right]\\) is the overlying dissolved oxygen concentration, \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{DOM}\\) is the user specified half saturation concentration of dissolved oxygen for dissolved organic matter sediment flux, \\(\\theta_{sed}^{DOM}\\) is the corresponding temperature coefficient, and \\(T\\) is ambient water temperature.

As per silicate sediment flux (see Section E.1), the above equations lead to linearly varying ambient dissolved organics concentrations in the demonstration model when dissolved oxygen concentration, half saturation oxygen concentrations and ambient temperature are set to be constant. A more realistic environmental setting has sediment dissolved organic fluxes occurring against a background of oxygen concentration drawdown. The demonstration model has been used to illustrate this via execution of a suite of simulations that experience dissolved oxygen drawdown (in the dissolved oxygen constituent model, with \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{O_2}\\) = 4 mg/L) and each simulation using the same value for \\(K_{sed-O_2}^{DOM}\\). The dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus sediment flux rates were specified as 1272, 224 and 31 mg/m\\(^2\\)/d (in the mass equivalent of the Redfield molar ratio of 106:16:1 C:N:P), and temperature effects were turned off.

The magnitudes of the dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus curves are as per the user specified fluxes, which reflect typical organic matter composition. Dissolved organic matter fluxes are also related to ambient water temperature, via the Arrhenius model in Equation (N.1). To demonstrate this, the same model above (with time varying dissolved oxygen concentration) was executed at a range of ambient temperatures, but a constant half saturation concentration for oxygen for dissolved organic matter sediment flux set to 4 mg/L. \\(\\theta_{sed}^{DOM}\\) was set to 1.05.

It is therefore a source of dissolved carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, and a sink of the corresponding particulates. Hydrolysis neither consumes or produces dissolved oxygen or bioavailable inorganic nutrients. Hydrolysis is implemented within the labile organics constituent model of the WQM, and the term organic matter in this section therefore refers to labile organic matter.

N.4 Mineralisation Mineralisation is the pelagic biological conversion of labile dissolved organic matter to dissolved inorganic carbon and nutrients. It is therefore a source of dissolved inorganic carbon, ammonium and free reactive phosphorus, and a sink of the corresponding labile dissolved organics. Mineralisation also consumes dissolved oxygen and (if anaerobic mineralisation is allowed to occur, see below) inorganic nitrate. Mineralisation is implemented within the labile organics constituent model of the WQM, and the term organic matter in this section therefore refers to labile organic matter.

In addition, the rate at which mineralisation of dissolved organic matter (to inorganics) occurs is the same for all dissolved organic constituents. This is because there is one (not three) biological conversion process that is assumed to draw equally on all dissolved organic constituents. N.4.1 Consumption The mineralisation rate from Equation (N.8) is multiplied by ambient labile dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations to compute their respective consumptive fluxes (losses) at each model timestep in each model cell via Equation (N.9). \\[\\begin{equation} \\left.\\begin{aligned} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagDOCMiner}{F_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC}} =&amp; R_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOM} \\times \\left[ DOC \\right] \\\\ \\\\ \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagDONMiner}{F_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DON}} =&amp; R_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOM} \\times \\left[ DON \\right] \\\\ \\\\ \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagDOPMiner}{F_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOP}} =&amp; R_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOM} \\times \\left[ DOP \\right] \\end{aligned}\\right\\} \\tag{N.9} \\end{equation}\\] Dissolved oxygen is consumed by aerobic mineralisation of dissolved organic carbon.

This quantity is computed via Equation (N.10), with the \\(K_{miner-O_2}^{DOM}\\), \\(\\left[DO\\right]\\) and \\(f_{an}\\) quantities described previously. \\[\\begin{equation} F_{miner-aer\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC} = F_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC} \\times \\underbrace{\\frac{\\frac{\\left[DO\\right]}{K_{miner-O_2}^{DOM} + \\left[DO\\right]}}{\\frac{\\left[DO\\right]}{K_{miner-O_2}^{DOM} + \\left[DO\\right]} + f_{an} \\times \\frac{K_{miner-O_2}^{DOM}}{K_{miner-O_2}^{DOM} + \\left[DO\\right]}}}_{\\text{Proportion of mineralisation that is aerobic}} \\tag{N.10} \\end{equation}\\] Substituting Equations (N.8) and (N.9) into Equation (N.10) and cancelling terms gives the expression for the aerobic component of dissolved organic carbon mineralisation flux as Equation (N.11), again with parameters described previously. \\[\\begin{equation} F_{miner-aer\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC} = F_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC} \\times \\frac{\\left[DO\\right]}{K_{miner-O_2}^{DOM} + \\left[DO\\right]} \\tag{N.11} \\end{equation}\\] The flux of consumed diatomic oxygen is set to be equal to the consumptive DOC flux (i.e. a 1:1 molar ratio and a molar weight adjusted mass ratio) via Equation (N.12). \\[\\begin{equation} F_{miner-aer\\langle computed\\rangle}^{O_2} = F_{miner-aer\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC} \\tag{N.12} \\end{equation}\\] This is also expressed as the reduction of ambient dissolved oxygen concentration that would result from this consumptive aerobic mineralisation over a period of five days. It is a common laboratory reporting unit and referred to as BOD5 (biological oxygen demand over 5 days). BOD5 is computed as per Equation (N.13). \\[\\begin{equation} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagOrgBDO5}{BOD5_{\\langle computed\\rangle}^{O_2}} = F_{miner-aer\\langle computed\\rangle}^{O_2} \\times 5 \\tag{N.13} \\end{equation}\\] Inorganic nitrate is consumed by anaerobic mineralisation of dissolved organic carbon, if \\(f_{an}\\) is set to be greater than zero. This consumptive flux of nitrate is referred to as denitrification. It is the reduction of nitrate N to free diatomic nitrogen gas, and in the WQM this loss of nitrate is set to be equal (i.e. in a 1:1 molar ratio and a molar weight adjusted mass ratio) to the flux of dissolved organic carbon due only to anaerobic mineralisation, \\(F_{miner-anaer\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC}\\). This anaerobic quantity is computed via Equation (N.14), using previously computed quantities. \\[\\begin{equation} F_{miner-anaer\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC} = F_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC} - F_{miner-aer\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC} \\tag{N.14} \\end{equation}\\] The flux of consumed nitrate is set to be equal to the consumptive DOC flux (i.e. a 1:1 molar ratio) via Equation (N.15) \\[\\begin{equation} F_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NO_3} = F_{miner-anaer\\langle computed\\rangle}^{DOC} \\tag{N.15} \\end{equation}\\] Finally, this nitrate consumptive flux is modified by a Michaelis-Menten formulation as Equation (N.16). \\[\\begin{equation} \\href{AppDiags.html#WQDiagOrgDenitrif}{F_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NO_3}} = F_{miner\\langle computed\\rangle}^{NO_3} \\times \\frac{\\left[NO_3\\right]}{K_{miner-NO_3}^{NO_3} + \\left[NO_3\\right]} \\tag{N.16} \\end{equation}\\] \\(K_{miner-NO_3}^{NO_3}\\) is the user specified half saturation concentration of nitrate for consumption of nitrate as result of anaerobic mineralisation of dissolved organic carbon and \\(\\left[NO_3\\right]\\) is the ambient nitrate concentration.

Contact support@tuflow.com if the DIC model is required. N.5 Activation Activation is the pelagic biological conversion of refractory dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus to their respective labile dissolved organic equivalents. It is therefore a source of dissolved labile organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, and a sink of the corresponding refractory dissolved organics. Activation does not consume or produce any other computed variables, although its computed rate does depend on dissolved oxygen concentration.

For each cell and at each timestep, this quantity \\(Ke_{\\langle computed \\rangle}^{OM}\\) is computed and returned to TUFLOW as a two- or three-dimensional field which TUFLOW then includes these in subsequent light distribution calculations.

If this is not the case, then timestamp syncronisation issues may arise and lead to spurious conservation analysis Geometry Four three-dimensional flat bottomed columns, with the same bed elevation Lateral cell areas each of approximately 10 km\\(^2\\) Depth of 20 metres 20 vertical layers, with 17 fixed and 3 sigma Boundary conditions No inflows, outflows or other flow boundaries Meteorological boundaries applied Hourly timestep Typical mid latitude autumnal conditions, with rainfall included Initial conditions Dissolved oxygen: 8.0 mg/L Silicate: 1.0 mg/L Ammonium: 0.15 mg/L Nitrate: 0.2 mg/L FRP: 0.04 mg/L Phytoplankton: 2.0 \\(mu\\)g/L Water quality parameterisation WQM control files that present the parameters used are included below for each simulation This static water setup was designed to be challenging for mass conservation. In particular, the exclusion of external flow boundaries (that can reset or overwhelm internal process calculations) was deliberate. These conditions mimic a low rainfall lacustrine environment. The primary calculation used to assess mass conservation for each computed variable \\(X\\) follows: \\[\\begin{equation} X_{mb}(t) = 100 \\times \\frac{X_{mp}(t) - X_{mi}(t)}{X_{mi}(t)} \\tag{R.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(X_{mb}(t)\\) is the percentage difference between two methods of computing the mass of computed variable \\(X\\) in the domain: \\(X_{mp}(t)\\): Progressively modifying the initial domain mass by adding to it the sum of the relevant fluxes \\(F_i\\) at each timestep \\(t\\). No resetting of this calculation occurs - it is designed (stringently) such that any mass conservation errors will accumulate in time \\(X_{mi}(t)\\): Multiplying the reported concentrations of \\(X\\) in cell \\(j\\) of volume \\(V_j\\) and integrating over the entire model domain at each timestep \\(t\\). This mass is reset at each timestep and corresponds to the mass reported by TUFLOW FV \\(X_{mp}(t)\\) and \\(X_{mi}(t)\\) are computed as per Equation (R.2). \\(F_{i}(t)\\) are the relevant fluxes for \\(X\\) (up to a total number of \\(i=NF\\) fluxes) and are converted from per area (or per volume) and per time amounts to mass (or moles) amounts. The number of cells in the domain is \\(NC\\), and \\(\\left[X\\right]_{j}(t)\\) is the concentration of computed variable \\(X\\) in cell \\(j\\) at time \\(t\\). The model contains sigma layers and as such \\(V_{j}\\) may be time varying. \\[\\begin{equation} \\left.\\begin{aligned} X_{mp}(t) =&amp; \\sum_{j=1}^{NC} \\left[X\\right]_{j}(0) \\times V_j(0) + \\sum_{i=1}^{NF} F_{i}(t) \\\\ \\\\ X_{mi}(t) =&amp; \\sum_{j=1}^{NC} \\left[X\\right]_{j}(t) \\times V_j(t) \\end{aligned}\\right\\} \\tag{R.2} \\end{equation}\\] Three simulation types were set, with one for each of the DO, inorganics and organics simulation classes. The timeseries of \\(X_{mb}(t)\\) for all relevant computed variables are presented below. R.1 Simulation class: DO The computed variables presented are: Dissolved oxygen The relevant fluxes considered are: Dissolved oxygen Sediment flux Atmospheric flux The mass conservation performance of the WQM is presented in Figure R.1, via \\(DO_{mb}\\). Over the duration of the simulation, mass conservation holds to within 0.02%. Figure R.1: Dissolved oxygen mass balance parameter \\(DO_{mb}(t)\\) The WQM fluxes \\(F\\) that were used to compute \\(DO_{mp}(t)\\) are presented in Figure R.2. Figure R.2: Dissolved oxygen WQM fluxes \\(F\\) used to compute \\(DO_{mp}(t)\\) Following are the WQM control file commands used to generate the above. simulation class == DO wq dt == 900.0 wq units == mgl oxygen model == O2 oxygen min max == 0.0, 12.0 oxygen benthic == 4.7, 1.08 end oxygen model material == default oxygen flux == -400.0 end material material == 1 oxygen flux == -100.0 end material material == 2 oxygen flux == -200.0 end material material == 3 oxygen flux == -300.0 end material R.2 Simulation class: Inorganics Two suites of simulations are presented. The first is with phytoplankton productivity and respiration set to zero, and the second sets these to positive values. This has been undertaken for calrity, and to allow the mass conservation properties of inorganic and phytoplankton computed variables to be isolated. R.2.1 Zero phytoplankton productivity and respiration The computed variables presented are: Dissolved oxygen Silicate Ammonium Nitrate FRP The relevant fluxes considered are: Dissolved oxygen Sediment flux Atmospheric flux Silicate Sediment flux Ammonium Sediment flux Atmospheric flux (wet and dry deposition) Nitrate Sediment flux Atmospheric flux (wet and dry deposition) FRP Sediment flux Atmospheric flux (wet deposition only as adsorbed FRP is not included in the simulation) The mass conservation performance of the WQM is presented in Figure R.3, via \\(DO_{mb}(t)\\), \\(Si_{mb}(t)\\), \\(Amm_{mb}(t)\\), \\(Nit_{mb}(t)\\) and \\(FRP_{mb}(t)\\). Over the duration of the simulation, mass conservation again holds to within 0.02%. Figure R.3: Inorganics mass balance parameters \\(DO_{mb}(t)\\), \\(Si_{mb}(t)\\), \\(Amm_{mb}(t)\\), \\(Nit_{mb}(t)\\) and \\(FRP_{mb}(t)\\) The WQM fluxes \\(F\\) that were used to \\(Si_{mp}(t)\\), \\(Amm_{mp}(t)\\), \\(Nit_{mp}(t)\\) and \\(FRP_{mp}(t)\\) are presented in Figure R.4. For clarity, oxygen fluxes are not presented because they are of a significantly different magnitude to all other fluxes.
